“台独”运动是台湾社会的一个毒瘤。所谓“台湾独立”，就是主张把台湾从中国分裂出去。主张“台湾独立”的分裂运动是从抗日战争胜利后、台湾回归中国版图后开始的，并一直延续到今天。

爱国体现了人们对自己祖国的深厚感情，反映了个人对祖国的依存关系，是人们对自己故土家园、民族和文化的归属感、认同感、尊严感与荣誉感的统一。它是调节个人与祖国之间关系的道德要求、政治原则和法律规范，也是民族精神的核心。每个人来到这个世界，都要在社会中生存，都要获取生存发展的物质条件，都要寻求慰藉心灵的精神家园，这一切首先得之于祖国。没有国哪有家，没有家哪有我——这看似平常的话语，道出了最深刻的爱国理由：国家是小家的寄托，更是个人的寄托；国家是物质利益的寄托，更是精神家园的寄托。失去祖国母亲的保护，个人就是无家可归的流浪儿。爱国是每个人都应当自觉履行的责任或义务。履行爱国的责任或义务，是对祖国母亲的报答。
