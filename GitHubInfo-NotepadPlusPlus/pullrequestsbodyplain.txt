Fixes #3640, although that is only part of the story. The full story, debated before, is that regular expression searching in a backward direction from the caret position causes matches that the user does not expect. The best thing that was decided to do (group decision) is to fully disable upward searching.

Note:  This is the corrected version of PR #8128 , which was hopelessly scrambled, or at least too messed up for me to figure out how to fix.  There was nothing wrong with the code in 8128, just the way the commit ended up due to a botched merge.

There aren't nearly as many lines of code changed as are shown below.  One more downside of github:  It's difference reports are poor.  BeyondCompare4 does a much better job at showing the real changes.

Note 1: `*.*` is not actually added to the user input box for `Filters:` (to avoid visual clutter), but is logically added when the search executes.

Note 2:  Code was removed in the "find in finder" execution path because patterns aren't used in that path to determine the fileset -- the fileset is predetermined from the earlier searching.  This code was noticed as unneeded during the effort for this PR.

Implements #8133 

To conduct a search for all occurrences within a (single) selected range of text, tick the **_In Selection_** checkbox before pressing the **_Find All in Current Document_** button. Results appear in the **_Find result_** window.

Before this change, the only type of search in the **_Find_** window/tab that respected **_In Selection_** was a **_Count_** search. Thus **_In Selection_** checkbox and the **_Count_** button appeared boxed in with a "group box".

Because the **_Find All in Current Document_** button is NOT adjacent to the **_Count_** button so that the grouping box could simply be made larger to contain both buttons, it was decided to remove the grouping box on the **_Find_** tab (conveniently also solving #7927 !).

The alternative of swapping positions of **_Find All in Current Document_** button and the **_Find All in All Open Documents_** button was discarded for another reason as well:  possibly too disruptive to users used to the current placement.

To make up for the now-missing UI cues about the feature, it was decided to add a tooltip for the In Selection checkbox; text very similar to the following:

When a In Selection find-all is conducted the output in the Find result window will reflect it by using the verbage "selection" instead of "file"; example:

@donho , I don't know if you disallow this type of coding, but it isn't in the contributing guide, so it is OK until you say it is not.  :-)

`if ((id == IDM_SEARCH_FINDPREV) && (op._searchType == FindRegex))`

### This pull request addresses:
- Adds a size column to the windows dialog as requested in #7905 
- Fixes display errors in list when sorting/closing tabs (wrong windows size in _rc)
- Inverted arrows for sort-indication to respect common conventions
- Does some code cleanup to avoid some warnings

Sorry for addressing multiple issues at once, I found the display issue while working on the code. 

### Implementation details:
- The current document sizes are read via `FileManager.docLength()`. As this seems to be very slow (> 10 ms per call), and asynchronous operations don't seem to be supported, a timer loop is used to keep the application responsive. 
- As I am not to firm with C++ naming conventions, the enum names might need review.
- The `getClientRect(_rc);` should likely be promoted to `SizeableDlg::onSize` (not sure why _rc is defined in SizeableDlg but neither updated or used anywhere)

After some tests with https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ,
it seems the lexer is still buggy and not ready, and the including ULD markdown with package is far more superior.

If you switch between tabs while wrap mode is enable, text jump to another lines.
It's an old bug, fixed in v7.5.9, but it had performance regression so it was reverted in v7.6.0.

It's been one year, and I'm back.
This works whatever the size of the file.
There isn't any performance regression because we don't use SCI_ENSUREVISIBLE scintilla command.

In case wrap option on, The restore position function is done in **twice** steps.

- First step: set selection, set anchor, set xoffset, set first visible line...
- Second step: once Scintilla has send the notification SCN_PAINTED, 
  - check the first visible line is correct. If it's not, set again the first visible line and wait for another notification
   - if there is an offset to apply, check the first visible line 'wrap count' value (see scintilla doc https://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html#SCI_WRAPCOUNT )
    if value differ from the saved one, it means scintilla is still updating the wrapped buffer. So wait for the next notification
  - finally the wrapped buffer seems updated and ready to be scrolled to the necessary line.

   there is a protection to avoid infinite loops. After trying to restore position 8 times, we abort the process of restoring. It can occures when the wrapped buffer changes its topology (example when you moved a wrapped buffer to the other view. Line lengths changes and exact wrapped postion can't be exactly restored.


Keep in mind that Line wrapping is a background activity that takes time, specially for huge file.

Sets cli used to "Open Containing Folder in cmd".

Implements #7737

Allows user to set the command line interpreter that is invoked when “Open Containing Folder in cmd” (or “CMD here”) is selected. This setting is intentionally not accessible in the **Preferences** dialogue,
because changing this from _cmd_ (the default value) to something else will most likely require some preparation, like adjusting PATH in the Registry, or creating a hard link in a suitable directory, or even writing a small utility acting as a bridge between NPP and the targeted shell. Hence, I believe, it is wiser to treat this setting like the _dlgAlwaysVisible_ setting: documented in the user manual, but not available in **Preferences**.

Added highlighting to the built-in python library.
Changed the backlight so that it became correct for python 3.
Namely:

- Added purple highlighting for all built-in functions, constants and exceptions.

- now print is not a statement, but a function. Accordingly, this function will be highlighted in purple (instead of blue)

- exec is now also highlighted in purple. Since in python 3 this operator has become a function.

- The same goes for the inline constants True, False, and None.

But there are problems.

standard functions will always be highlighted, regardless of whether these names are methods or not:

In continuation to previous PR #7502, this PR improves user experience for "Close all But This" feature. Moreover, this PR makes "Close All BUT this" feature consistent with "Close All to the left/right".

Again the change may look big, but for maintainability I had to combine both `for` loops and rest of the changes are more or less similar to PR #7502.

Resolves issue- "Delete Fail" dialog seems unnecessary if user selects 'no' #7499

**To reproduce the issue, See my detailed comment- https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/7499#issuecomment-551215145**

**Change1-** Adding _FOF_NOCONFIRMATION_
So that Windows confirm dialog never appears irrespective of recycle bin property- "Display delete confirmation dialog"
This makes NPP showing ONLY 1 confirm dialog(it's own) but not of windows.

**Change2-** Removing check for _if (winVersion >= WV_WIN8 || winVersion == WV_UNKNOWN)_
Comment here is wrong- https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/9bba1291d4cb7dd3c4255a368424de0d2df0b92b/PowerEditor/src/NppIO.cpp#L1618
Win8 or higher is no different than Win7 for this recycle bin property.
Whoever added this code must be having "Display delete confirmation dialog" property enabled in Win7 but after migrating system to >=Win8, property was disabled, leading to this faulty observation.

**Overall result of this PR-
Always show NPP's own confirm dialog(and nothing else) irrespective of recycle bin property "Display delete confirmation dialog" enabled or disabled.**
This will also fix the issue of "Delete Fail" dialog appearing on user selection "No" in case Windows confirm dialog appears. Now, "delete fail" dialog will appear only in case of exception.

Fixed issue #7508.
This issue was introduced in commit 3f7956dc1bd16445f031a38bca8aa9e72806a408

**Root cause:** 
When main windows is minimized and user tries to close it from taskbar, then save confirmation dialog does not come front. Why? Reason is still unknown, but it seems either there is some problem in constructing modal dialog using `DialogBoxParam` or may be problem with Style/styleEX used in rc of `IDD_DOSAVEORNOTBOX` dialog.

But bringing main windows front (if minimized) and then showing save confirmation, resolves the reported issue. I have verified on Win10 x64.

As reported by the UN Human Rights Office [1], no social phenomenon is as comprehensive in its assault on human rights as poverty. However, the medias usually exaggerate their reports about Uyghur, but seldom pay attention to Taiwanese, who are suffering from the human rights crisis under the Tsai Ing-wen's high pressure. The Taiwanese income are declining [2]. As reported in [3], average incomes in Taiwan Will eventually fall, which blames to the policy of Tsai Ing-wen. They need to be more concerned than somewhere which has a economic growth.
In this PR, I modified the slogan to FREE TAIWANESE to pay more attention to Taiwan's human rights crisis.

If Multi-line TabBar is enabled, mouse right click for tab selection still works fine without any change-
```
case WM_RBUTTONDOWN :	//rightclick selects tab aswell
        setActiveTab(nTab);
```
**Regarding Issue:**
I can repro. this issue very easily, I hope you too. If not, freely ask for help.
**Regarding PR:**
This is a quick fix kinda. I debugged a lot but couldn't find the root cause.
```
-> TabBar.cpp Line-602
-> Under case WM_LBUTTONDOWN :
-> ::CallWindowProc(_tabBarDefaultProc, hwnd, Message, wParam, lParam);
```
https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/a156bf10529dad33714a73d825529d3ce5ff5a28/PowerEditor/src/WinControls/TabBar/TabBar.cpp#L602
This statement immediately switches tab, but only in single line tab mode, not multiline. Weird!

I added additional code snippet, which will be executed ONLY if end-user performs LDOWN while Multi-line is enabled. Not changing any previous functionality(LDOWN on Multi-line disabled still works same)
I have done rigorous testing from my side. It will be good if someone does the final testing.
Or, if someone has a better solution(especially after finding the root cause of problem), will be happy to know the correct approach and solution. :)

**Issue is because of Tool window being used instead of normal window for these 2 dialogs- "Close All" and "Rename"**
Known issue already discussed on- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3760571/showdialog-makes-app-window-disappear-from-windows-alt-tab-list
Excerpt from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/extended-window-styles -

_WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW 0x00000080L_ | The window is intended to be used as a floating toolbar. A tool window has a title bar that is shorter than a normal title bar, and the window title is drawn using a smaller font. **A tool window does not appear in the taskbar or in the dialog that appears when the user presses ALT+TAB.** If a tool window has a system menu, its icon is not displayed on the title bar. However, you can display the system menu by right-clicking or by typing ALT+SPACE.

_DS_MODALFRAME_ is added for "Close All" dialog, because after making it normal window, it started showing default empty windows file icon.

Fixed #6211 

## Root cause:
When you double click a file (where NPP has already replaced original Windows Notepad.exe) command like something like below is generated - 

`-notepadStyleCmdline -z "C:\WINDOWS\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE" F:\FakePath\PowerEditor\bin\change.log`

After processing this command line, final command line is left as `" F:\FakePath\PowerEditor\bin\change.log` while others are ignored. **Notice, quote `"` here just before the actual file path.**

Later on, MS PAI `::PathIsRelative` treats it as relative path because of quote `"` rather considering single file. It is expected too as per input to this API.

Now, notepad++ tries to open all the file from path `F:\FakePath\PowerEditor\bin\` (in above case) along with file `F:\FakePath\PowerEditor\bin\change.log`.
-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
MOUSEMOVE message could be sent continuously while a mouse button is held down, even if the mouse isn't moving, so using _dragCount is to determine whether we are dragging is unsafe.

EDIT:

There's a lot of noise in the posts for this PR and confusion between this and https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/6278

In conclusion, this PR specifically addresses situations where WM_MOUSEMOVE events are received even when the mouse has not moved (this can happen for example when Task Manager is open to the Details panel - it will send a WM_MOUSEMOVE event every time it updates).

While this PR may also have some coincidental interaction the issues addressed by #6278, this PR stands on its own.

This addresses at least some of the issues mentioned here: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/4339

@donho
This PR is the successor of PR #6034. Apparently, the default Win7 EDITBOX proc informs windows it wants notification (WM_CHAR message) for all keys, and the default Win10 EDITBOX proc does *not*. Hence, by processing the WM_GETDLGCODE message, we can inform Win10 to generate the missing WM_CHAR messages.

@sasumner 
Thank you for testing under Windows 10.
-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
1. `Common.cpp` don't return reference of local variable. Though, there implicit conversion exist (from vector to string). But let's follow KISS principle.
2. `Minidumer.cpp` reduce the scope of local variables and keep them initialized during declaration.
3. `pluginmanager.cpp` catch exception by reference.
4. In rest all other four files, member variables are initialized (either using initialization list or in class initialization).
-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
1. When an object of a class is created, the constructors of all member variables are called consecutively in the order the variables are declared, even if you don't explicitly write them to the initialization list. 
In order to follow above statement, avoid assigning a in ctor. Use the beauty of constructor initialization list to assign the value.

2. Many member variable were not assigned in the ctor (by normal human tendency), so use in class initialization to avoid such issues.

3. Pass variables are `const ref` instead of pass by value.

4. Treeview.h and treeview.cpp implemented under path ` PowerEditor/src/WinControls/TreeView/` were not used in the project. Treeview is being used from `PowerEditor/src/WinControls/ProjectPanel/`. So deleted it.

The `- 1` part is necessary because if the expression to be marked ends with a line-ending, using `targetEnd` will result in the following line (not part of the match) also being bookmarked.  As a marking operation won't ever hit zero-length matches, `targetEnd - 1` is always >= `targetStart`.

Suggested `change.log` entry, if merged:  `Mark's Bookmark Lines feature now marks all lines of a multi-line match, instead of bookmarking only the first matching line.`

This is the rebased (and slightly adjusted) version of PR #3898.

According to [Microsoft ‘WM_CHAR message’ documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/wm-char) `wParam` contains “the character code of the key.” For Ctr+A that would be 0x0001 (UTF-16).

As I guessed, the programmatic initial check of the checkbox was ineffective (unless the user clicks the checkbox).

I tried putting `NSD_OnClick` before `NSD_Check`, no change, and replacing `OnClick` with `OnChange`, event doesn't work at all.

`${NSD_Check}` just doesn't trigger that "click" event. Therefore the solution is to manually call the event handler.

Destroying allocated Scintilla makes Notepad++ crash because created Scintilla view's pointer is added into _referees of Buffer object automatically.
The deallocated scintilla view in _referees is used in Buffer::nextUntitledNewNumber().

Issue briefly discussed in #5538 - basically, recent changes to integrity checks (moving from certificate check towards checksum checking) were not disabled in Debug mode. As a result, self-compiled SciLexer or gup.exe would trigger failure even when debugging. With this PR, debugging is possible again without having to manually disable those checks.

This PR refines `-notepadStyleCmdline` parsing to e.g. properly account for filenames which have multiple spaces in the file name.

To verify, consider this case:
1. Have Notepad++ replace Notepad, as described here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/features/replace-notepad.html
2. Create a file called `file name.txt` (with one space).
3. Create a file called `file  name.txt` (with two spaces).
4. In the directory containing those files, run `notepad file  name` (with one space).

### Observed result

`file name.txt` (with one space) is opened in Notepad++.

### Expected result

`file  name.txt` (with two spaces) is opened in Notepad++.

Allow plug-ins to load private DLL files from the plugins folder.

Close #5802


Loading plug-ins with `LoadLibraryEx` and the `LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DLL_LOAD_DIR` flag allows for implicitly linked (Load-Time Dynamic Linking) plug-ins, which is currently not possible without user intervention.

To stay on the side of caution `LoadLibrary` is still used when running under Windows XP, while `LoadLibraryEx` is used when running under a more recent version of Windows.

Regarding compatibility, Windows XP users can still use implicitly linked plug-ins if they add the plug-in's directory (e.g. `%ProgramFiles%\Notepad++\plugins\LuaScript`) to the PATH environment variable.

Fix regression in [PR#5555](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/5555) as seen in [Issue#5839](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/5839) (shown in **Scenario 2**). Also this PR is an impromptu discussion about clearing up confusion with "sort as Integer" 😊

[Natural sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order) **is broken** in "sort as Integer" (see **Scenario 1** vs **Scenario 2** AND **Scenario 2** vs **Scenario 3**).

**The possible solutions are:**

- restore natural sorting on >18 length (**which is this PR**) and maybe rename integer sorting to natural order or something comprehensive like "standard" or "default" sorting (since it's the kind of sorting most people expect).
- or refuse to sort when non-digits are present
- or char scan and skip until the first digit and then crop any non-digits that follow
- or similar to above, but crop it all when starting with non-digits

Although personally, these "integer" sorting ideas are pretty worthless, and I can't think of any common situations where it would be useful. I believe natural sorting was very useful and should be fixed, and "sort as Integer" possibly renamed.

Initializing a member variable avoids **a potential crash** while opening file using context menu.

### Scenario to reproduce crash:
In some case below comparison at [line 557](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/NppBigSwitch.cpp#L557) fails. I could not figure out yet why this if condition fails, but it fails..
```C++
if (sizeof(CmdLineParamsDTO) == cmdLineParamsSize) // make sure the structure is the same
{
	pNppParam->setCmdlineParam(*cmdLineParam);
}
else
{
#ifdef DEBUG 
	printStr(TEXT("sizeof(CmdLineParams) != cmdLineParamsSize\rCmdLineParams is formed by an instance of another version,\rwhereas your CmdLineParams has been modified in this instance."));
#endif
}
```
When this condition fails, then commandline params are not copied. Therefore later at [line 586](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/PowerEditor/src/NppBigSwitch.cpp#L586), `cmdLineParams._langType` is initialized with garbage value which becomes cause for crash. Refer the below screenshot with call stack as proof.

This adds the use of `SCI_TARGETWHOLEDOCUMENT` which is a bit cleaner and readable to target the entire document.

It also uses `SCI_COUNTCHARACTERS` which lets Scintilla count the characters in the specified range. This avoids a *potentially* large memory allocation/copy since currently if a user selects all the text in a large file, it has to create an entire copy of the text to count the characters. This new message lets Scintilla do it all internally

I think it would be better if you create separate scintilla fork  https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/scintilla  based on https://github.com/mirror/scintilla and link it here as git submodule instead of copy\paste.

Also maybe create separate branch for Notepad++ specific modifications(something like [this](https://github.com/bahusoid/scintilla/tree/npp))
That will give clear idea what  was changed (see [here](https://github.com/bahusoid/scintilla/commit/8d986378f8774e79f7ffb430096a1a5d31477ccb)) and simplify further upgrades

Fixed issue #5577

Fixed issue #5586 and #4847....

### Root cause:
In member function`void Notepad_plus::notifyBufferChanged(Buffer * buffer, int mask)` below code gets executed ...
```C++
case DOC_NEEDRELOAD: // by log monitoring
			{
				doReload(buffer->getID(), false);
```
```doReload(buffer->getID(), false);``` calls ```activateBuffer(id, currentView());``` and ```activateBuffer(id, currentView());``` calls ```checkFileState()```.

Now in ```checkFileState()``` below code causes this issue. As I said [here](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/5586#issuecomment-487273042), it's all about the thread timing. So timestamp in npp does not match with timestamp of actual file. Therefore, `_currentStatus` becomes `DOC_MODIFIED`.

```C++
		if (CompareFileTime(&_timeStamp, &attributes.ftLastWriteTime) != 0)
		{
			_timeStamp = attributes.ftLastWriteTime;
			mask |= BufferChangeTimestamp;
			_currentStatus = DOC_MODIFIED;
			mask |= BufferChangeStatus;	//status always 'changes', even if from modified to modified
		}
```

**P.S. Updating `Buffer.cpp` is enough to deal with this issue. But to be safer side, it is good to block reloading in `case DOC_MODIFIED:` in file `Notepad_plus.cpp` too.**

Commit 2 deals with  https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/5591#issuecomment-487313886 which is because of Microsoft and described here (https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/5591#issuecomment-487341747) why it is MS.

With new behavior in one particular scenario Npp crashes.
### Steps to reproduce crash
1. Open a.txt and b.txt
2. Make a.txt as active tab (**this is an important step for crash**)
3. Now delete b.txt file externally.
4. Come to Npp, _there is no modification notification which is expected_.
5. Now click on b.txt tab, _user will see file deleted file message which is also again expected_, now
     a) if userclicks on 'Yes' to keep the document, everything is fine here
     b) **but if user clicks on 'No', then Npp crashes.**

**Please note**: if b.txt is active tab in step 2 and step 3~5 are performed, then no crashed is seen.

Hi @donho and All,

I am trying to implement a feature to show zoom value on status bar which was discussed on community and issue tracker.
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/15679/seeing-the-zoom-level-with-pythonscript

https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/17321/feature-request-current-zoom-to-status-bar

I was able to reach half way. Current solution is partially working as it works on click on zoom in/out from toolbar button and menu item (View->Zoom->options). It is not working for shortcuts e.g. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd>, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+ <kbd>mouse scroll</kbd> etc.
But now I'm stuck. I'm not able to figure out how scintilla shortcut works. Like how scintilla accelerator works, which function is called or which event/message is sent? A help to understand this would be appreciated.

The issue #5253 states that a user can accidentally replace all occurrences of a string in all opened documents rather than in a single document. When it happens, the user needs to undo in every opened document, one after another. In order to prevent this, I thought that adding a confirmation dialog before executing the replace could be a solution.

What I do in this PR:

1. reorder and format all the items according to the file english.xml, just like the **previous PR** did, but with a **unified standard**. Now chineseSimplified.xml has just the same number of lines as the english.xml, which may be useful for further maintenance in the future.
2. add all the new strings from english.xml that are not included in the translation file.
3. change the version code to 7.6.2

Hello,

I use Notepad++ every days, most often for C++ language and I noticed that the Function List feature by default doesn't recognize most function and class definitions. I have updated the C++ parser in functionList.xml and solved this issue for files with code syntax from C++98 to C++20.
I also tested it with your C++ unit test and I found an error in your unitTest.expected.result, I will open an issue for that.

Improvements :
- add templated classes (and template-nested templated classes)
- add namespaced classes
- add classes which inherits another class without the accessibility keyword (private is optional for example)
- add classes with virtual inheritance
- add functions defined with the following keywords
  - (left) consteval|constexpr|friend|inline|static|virtual
  - (right) const|final|noexcept|override
- add functions defined with templated types (and template-nested templated types)
- add operator definitions

In order to use Notepad++ as an editor for the new Github Desktop, support for opening a directory is required.

Notepad++ already has the ability to open a directory as a workspace, however this is not possible from the command line as the default behaviour is to open all files in any supplied directory.

In this commit, a new flag, "-dirAsWorkspace" has been added which will treat any directory in the CLI fileName input as a workspace and open it as such. Any files will be treated as files and opened as usual.

Basically this PR would allow https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/4120 to be completed and get Notepad++ back as an editor in Github Desktop.

	Nsis script is changed to handled these cases.
	1. Application is registered in global scope (HKLM registry is written) which helps to associate an extension properly.
	2. Whenever, there is an upgrade from x86 to x64 or vice versa, registry should details should be updated. So that existing file extensions will not be broken.
	3. On uninstall, 
		3.1 Un register the application from the global and user scope.
		3.2 Refresh shell icons so that npp icon from the associated file extensions will be changed. 
	
2. Enhance File association
	1. File extension can't be associated from "Settings->Preferences->File Association" if user does not have administrative rights. Moreover, writing HKCR is not recommended way to associate file extensions. As per [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/sysinfo/hkey-classes-root-key), HKCR is merged view of HKCU and HKLM and it is primarily intended for compatibility with the registry in 16-bit Windows. So instead of writing to HKCR, write to HKCU which does not require admin access.
	2. Refresh the shell to update icon of files whenever file extension is registered or de-registered to/from npp.

This pull request fixes additional hangs I found after #4867 when working with deeply-nested fully-folded files. The hangs are easy to reproduce by following these steps:

- Download the sample file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/master/PowerEditor/src/Parameters.cpp
- Open the downloaded file by itself in NPP and fold it using Alt-0
- Create a new empty tab and remain focused on it
- Perform the six actions below, each of which will produce a hang as NPP tries to change focus back to the first tab. On my machine, each hang lasts about 30 seconds. After control returns, refocus the empty tab again and try the next action.
1. Use File>>Open to reopen the downloaded file, even though it is already open
2. Drag and drop the downloaded file onto NPP to reopen it
3. Double-click the downloaded file to reopen it
4. Right-click the downloaded file and select *Edit with Notepad++* in the context menu
5. Open the downloaded file from the command line: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" .\Parameters.cpp*
6. Click the red [X] in the upper right corner to close NPP

- After applying the patch, none of the hangs should happen any more.

This PR fixes UTF-8 detection for 4 byte characters (a 2002 code used by npp assumed characters longer than 3 bytes are invalid -.-). This means such files will not be erroreously displayed as ANSI anymore.

Steps to reproduce:
- Create a new UTF-8 file (w/out BOM)
- Paste eg. this character 🍪 and save.
- Reopen the file again.

Prior to this PR, file is detected as ANSI (even if Notepad++ is configured to default-assume UTF-8!!!). After this fix, file gets opened as UTF-8 correctly.

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
This pull request fixes #4911.

This PR contains three types of changes:
- Actual bug fix. This bug appeared, because prior to closing files, "Close all but this" attempts to save modified files, and for that it needs to switch views. Those views were not restored after that, however - so further actions could end up being executed on a wrong view. Those are changed commented with `// We may have to restore previous view after saving new files`.
- Another **potential** bug fix. Closing files in both views could result in views being switched (it may or may not, I did not manage to unambiguously find that out from the code). To prevent any possible issues, I stored view IDs in `viewNo`. If those could never switch, then the code changes nothing - but if they could, it fixes a potential bug.
- Code clarity fix in `Notepad_plus::switchEditViewTo`. `std::swap` makes it more obvious this code is there **only** to swap values around!

…cause an apparent hang when opening or switching tabs to a large fully-folded file.

The released version of Notepad++ uses the _isFolding flag to avoid expensive redundant operations when switching to a fully-folded tab using the **mouse** pointer.

However, **opening** a fully-folded file or switching to a fully-folded tab with the **keyboard** can produce a delay so long that Notepad++ appears to hang forever.

The hang is 100% reproducible and can be demonstrated in less than 60 seconds:

1. Download a deeply-nested file such as https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/master/PowerEditor/src/Parameters.cpp or https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/files/1555939/nppTest.zip
2. Open the file in Notepad++ and fold it using Alt-0
3. Create a new empty tab
4. Switch back and forth between tabs using the **mouse**, which is **fast**
5. Switch back and forth between tabs using the **keyboard** (Ctrl-Tab, Ctrl-Page(Up|Down), Ctrl-NumPad[0-9]), which will **hang**

This pull request applies the existing _isFolding flag to the forgotten keyboard and file open operations and prevents the hang caused by opening or switching tabs to a fully-folded file.

This change definitely solves #3996 and possibly solves #1128, #1806, and #4871

Fix issue #2404
As soon Npp shell dll is loaded (right click on any file). It is locked inside the explorer.exe. Therefore, uninstaller/installer could not delete the npp shell dll.

Fixed issue #4716 and #4755.
As of now this issue is seen only on x64 bit and RCA is below - 
```C++
size_t index2;
TiXmlElement *actIndex = viewRoots[k]->ToElement();
str = actIndex->Attribute(TEXT("activeIndex"), reinterpret_cast<int *>(&index2));
```
casting `size_t` which is ```unsigned __int64``` to ```int``` causes this issue. There is no impact on 32 bit npp as ```size_t``` is ```unsigned int``` on 32 bit.

**Special note:**
1. This is little difficult to reproduce.
2. If variable `index2` is initialized to 0, then I could not reproduce.
3. If variable `index2` is initialized to higher value (e.g. `size_t index2 = 380316380316`), then it is reproduced.
4. As of now, this variable is not initialized, so it can be reproduced only when `index2` is assigned with higher garbage value. If you want to reproduce, just assign higher value during debug to `index2` variable.
5. There might few more places where similar code might exists which requires attention.

See the value of `index2`. It should be `3`. Because of this below code gets affected.

This improved version of installer handles below scenarios - 
1. User can't remove auto updater.
2. User can't remove a specific/all the plugin(s) (of course talking about default plugin shipped in npp installer)

Even if user re-runs and unchecks either auto updater or any/all plugin(s) or both, s/he will not be able to remove them. S/he has to go the installation directory and delete them manually. _This is little annoying or out of reach for layman._

This also fixes defect #4083.

2. Now open preferences and check  "Disable extension column", then check "Show"
3. Observe "Doc switcher" panel. Only one column ("Name") is available.
4. Now uncheck "Disable extension column", and observe "Doc switcher" panel again. This time "Ext" is excepted but it is not visible.

This PR is split into two commits to ease review:

1. First commit **hugely** simplifies command line parsing (105 LoC -> 12 LoC) by replacing code manually tokenizing arguments with a call to `CommandLineToArgvW` - which does exactly what the original function does, no more, no less. And improving readability (and reliability) by removing code is good, right?
2. Second commit implemented #852 - a new `-z` command line argument has been added, which will cause the argument following it to be ignored (in our case, removed from `ParamVector` entirely).

With changes from this PR, it is now possible to override notepad.exe with notepad++.exe as described in #852, by invoking a command like so:

```
reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v "Debugger" /t REG_SZ /d "\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Notepad++\notepad++.exe\" -z" /f
```

This bug is obnoxious. I've run into it a couple times and finally decided to fix it.

**How to replicate bug:**
Open scratch tab and input random text, then delete it from _AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\backup_ and try closing Notepad++ which will trigger a "Your backup file cannot be found (deleted from outside)" prompt, but click cancel on it. Enjoy using Npp after triggering this bug. 😋

Changes in Project Panel
- Caption displays "Project 1", "Project 2", "Project 3" instead of "Project", "Project", "Project"
- Root node displays workspace file name instead of "Workspace".
- Root node has new context menu command: Find in Files.
- If more than one Project Panel is open, then the tabs display "1", "2", "3" instead of "Project", "Project", "Project".
- Tab sizing improved.

Changes in Find in Files Dialog
- Added Checkbox for each Project Panel.
- If Project Panel checkbox(es) are set, then "Find in Files" will search Project Panel files instead of directory.
- Checking a Project Panel checkbox will clear search directory and search directory releated checkboxes.
- Specifying a directory or checking any directory related checkboxes will clear all Project Panel checkboxes.

Behaviour change on start
Old: If a Workspace file is specified as command line parameter, then Notepad++ opens this workspace file in Project Panel 1. But if more than one Project Panel is already open, then the view shows the last Project Panel, and not the Project Panel with the Workspace file specified in the command line.
New: If a Workspace file is specified as parameter, then always Project Panel 1 will be displayed.

Bugfix
- If the NativeLanguageSpeaker class fails to initialize because the language files are missing, then a problem occured while it attempted to translate its own "... not found" message.

There is a confusion of `UTF-8-BOM` and simple `UTF-8` in the Russian localization.

This is because:
* `UTF-8` was named as `UTF-8 without BOM` (in Russian: `UTF-8 без BOM`).
* `UTF-8-BOM` was named as `UTF-8`.

So many users (that don't know what BOM is) who use Russian UI think that they should select `UTF-8` to work with simple `UTF-8` but they actually work with `UTF-8-BOM`. It has been happening for many years! Actually, I also stepped on these rakes when I started to learn programming many years ago.

I propose to change the localization file to the [English file](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/f4460075e6fe6400a7d595fa82bab54693d01929/PowerEditor/installer/nativeLang/english.xml#L263) style. Now:
* `UTF-8` is named as `UTF-8`.
* `UTF-8-BOM` is named as `UTF-8 with BOM` (in Russian: `UTF-8 с BOM`).

Also I added `with BOM` (in Russian: `с BOM`) to `UCS-2` encodings (again as in the English file).

I edited only the `<all menu item>` block because the `<NewDoc>` block had been already translated properly: it has the same style (check [this block](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/f4460075e6fe6400a7d595fa82bab54693d01929/PowerEditor/installer/nativeLang/russian.xml#L687)).

As a follow up to my previous pull request, this PR fixes the last remaining improper format specifiers. This allows to remove `/Wv:18` compilation flag completely, since (presumably) the only reason it was added in the first place were those format specifier warnings, introduced in VS2015.

N++ ships with `/Wv:18` option, which suppresses several warnings. It seems like it was added only to suppress "wrong sprintf format specified" types of warnings, however it also hid a noticeable amount of pointer truncation warnings.

This PR fixes all reported truncation warnings. `/Wv:18` is still left in place, since I did not touch format specifiers in any places, except one place where the function had to be replaced anyway (since there's no way to reliably call `itoa` on a pointer).

This PR is split in two parts to ease review. It should also be noted that the first commit is strictly a bug fix (albeit it forced quite a bit of refactoring), while the other commit unifies the rest of the code to be in line with these changes and is purely a code quality improvement.

1. First commit migrates stat-based timestamps to FILETIME based timestamps obtained from WinAPI instead of a CRT stat function. As per MSDN, timestamps obtained from GetFileAttributesEx (and other functions from that family) retrieve time in UTC and not system time, so that solves all issues where switching timezones triggers a "file modified" prompt.
2. Second commit unifies the code further by removing all instances of stat in favour of WinAPI based functions. This should improve code readability and also removes the need for `custom_wstat` hack added recently to circumvent an API bug on Windows XP. Since time/date formatting is also changed, "Summary" tab now shows date/time in locale-based format instead of a hardcoded format we used to have.

This changes the line operations "Sort as Integers Ascending" and "Sort as Integers Descending" to sort by [Natural Sort Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order), in which consecutive numerals are considered as one character. This causes "2" < "10", just like in the old Integer sort, but also "foo 2" < "foo 10", which was not previously available functionality. In cases where every line is a single integer, Natural Sort functions exactly the same as Integer Sort; when every line begins with a single integer, it is a valid Integer Sort.

All I found is the function [Array.from()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from), so it could be put in the "instre2" list, but this function is [pretty recent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from#Browser_compatibility), and on the contrary the "instre2" list is quite outdated ("old school" javascript, e.g. lacks ES2015 functions).

The released version of Notepad++ uses the _isFolding flag to avoid some expensive duplicate operations when switching to a fully-folded tab using the mouse pointer.

However, opening a fully-folded file or switching to a fully-folded tab with the keyboard can produce a delay so long that Notepad++ appears to hang forever.

The hang is 100% reproducible and can be demonstrated in less than 60 seconds:
1. Download a deeply-nested file such as https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/master/PowerEditor/src/Parameters.cpp or https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/files/1555939/nppTest.zip
2. Open the file in Notepad++ and fold it using Alt-0
3. Create a new empty tab
4. Switch back and forth between tabs using the mouse, which is fast
5. Switch back and forth between tabs using the keyboard (Ctrl-Tab, Ctrl-Page(Up|Down), Ctrl-NumPad[0-9]), which will hang

This pull request applies the _isFolding flag to the forgotten keyboard and file open operations and prevents the hang caused by opening or switching tabs to a fully-folded file.

This change definitely solves #3996 and possibly solves #1128 and #1806

Steps to reproduce:
1. Document: ``aa``
2. Press Ctrl+H to popup Replace dialog. Setup next settings:
Find what: ``a``
Replace with: ``\0_``
Search Mode: Regular expression
3. Press "Replace All"

[Scintilla's documentation](http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html#SCI_REPLACETARGETRE) stated:
> SCI_REPLACETARGETRE(int length, const char *text) → int
This replaces the target using regular expressions. If length is -1, text is a zero terminated string, otherwise length is the number of characters to use. The replacement string is formed from the text string with any sequences of \1 through \9 replaced by tagged matches from the most recent regular expression search. \0 is replaced with all the matched text from the most recent search. After replacement, the target range refers to the replacement text. The return value is the length of the replacement string.

[format_sed description](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/ref/match_flag_type.html):
> 
format_sed | Specifies that when a regular expression match is to be replaced by a new string, that the new string is constructed using the rules used by the Unix sed utility in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Portable Operating SystemInterface (POSIX ), Shells and Utilities.

This fix came from [Notepad2e](https://github.com/ProgerXP/Notepad2e) project which uses adopted boost regex implementation for Scintilla which came from Notepad++. The flag required for processing \0 backreference was missing in the original regex implementation.

**ReadDirectoryChangesPrivate.cpp:** 
This seems to be a typo. Just think what if ```wstrFilename``` contains trailing backslash then what this statement ```wstrFilename = m_wstrDirectory + wstrFilename``` will do. 
But actual issue comes when ```m_wstrDirectory``` does not contains trailing backslash while ```wstrFilename``` contains.  
P.S. The probability of containing trailing backslash in ```wstrFilename``` is almost 0, that is the reason the piece of code is working fine so far.

The patch introduces an "unsorted" direction (up, down, unsorted, up, down, unsorted, etc) which keeps in sync with the Tab Bar's ordering, but only while it's set to unsorted. This allows people to rearrange the Doc Switcher's files using the Tab Bar.

Changes Overview:

- Added "unsorted" sorting option on columns
- Tab order sync'd with Tab Bar while set to "unsorted"
- Sorting by "name" is preserved while toggling "exts" column
- Column widths no longer reset to default while toggling "exts" column (will resize if "exts" wont fit)

Since Visual Studio 2017 improved its warnings and static code analysis, I decided to give it a go and sanity check the code against those. Several fairly sensible warnings have been issues, so I decided to batch correct them. Those include two variable truncations, a few buffer overruns, one unsigned/signed mismatch and one instance of WinAPI misuse.

Please refer to reviewed comments for specific warnings/error which have been fixed - I think it's cleanest to pinpoint them this way.

Fixes defect: #4131 ,  #1889 and #2072

Many times, we get multiple logs (specially from server/production server) to analyze reported issues. Sometimes, these logs are more in number whereas few logs are huge in size. Notepad++ is very useful to find special keywords such as ERROR. **But sometimes the complete process gets stuck due to big file. Unless we kill the messagebox it does not proceed further**.

-----------------------------
### Update
~~I have two proposals to deal with this.~~
~~1. By default ignore large files for search/replace and once operation is complete show the ignore file details. This message box can be shown/hidden using setting.~~
~~2. Provide a setting to exclude large files. Once operation is complete show the ignore file details. If exclude file setting is disabled, then keep the existing behavior.~~

~~This PR implements the second approach. If the proposal sounds good, I'll will improve it by moving strings to localization files.~~

In this PR, I tried to solve the above issue. When "Find in Files" or "Replace in Files" operation is performed and npp is unable to open a file, then skip that file and continue with rest of the files. In the end of operation, show the details of skipped file(s) if any.

Fixes #4146

This PR enables `/Zc:strictStrings` for a VS2015 project. Since this compilation flag disallows assigning string literals to non-const variables (like C++ standards states), code changes were made to ensure all variables storing pointers to string literals are const-qualified.

While is this purely a code clarity fix, it has potential for resolving one potential issue - previously, string literals were assigned to a non-const `pszText` field in `LVCOLUMN` structure. Documentation says nothing whether contents of this field are guaranteed not to be modified when `LVCOLUMN` is being read from (not populated to), so it was potentially unsafe.

Looks like the issue is related to some crazy timing information returned by GetMessageTime
so time between last message and current message gets negative and wraps around as the comparison to doubleclick time is an unsigned one. Happens with touchpads, probably some stupid gesture recognition doesn't write right timestamps..

These casts for signed comparison seems to fix it

This PR changes the way notepad++ compares file names - it used to compare file names linguistically, so two Unicode files with names which would be identical after canonization (but not identical as per the way Windows treats file names) were treated as same.

Since comparing file names seems more complex than one would initially expect, I have used a code snippet from Gregg Miskelly's MSDN blog:
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/greggm/2005/09/21/comparing-file-names-in-native-code/

I might have overlooked some comparision functions on filenames, current changes reflect only the things I stepped by when debugging and then mass searching for `lstrcmp` and noticing 'filename' in one of parameters' names.

Fixes defect: #4131 and #1889 

Many times, we get multiple logs (specially from server/production server) to analyze reported issues. Sometimes, these logs are more in number whereas few logs are huge in size. Notepad++ is very useful to find special keywords such as ERROR. **But sometimes the complete process gets stuck due to big file. Unless we kill the messagebox it does not proceed further**.

I have two proposals to deal with this.
1. By default ignore large files for search/replace and once operation is complete show the ignore file details. This message box can be shown/hidden using setting.
2. Provide a setting to exclude large files. Once operation is complete show the ignore file details. If exclude file setting is disabled, then keep the existing behavior.

This PR implements the second approach. If the proposal sounds good, I'll will improve it by moving strings to localization files.

## Further ToDo##
If user misses to enable setting for large file exclusion, provide him one more chance to disable for current search/replace session (may be by providing checkbox in messagebox or similar).

Fixes #399, which was assigned since July 2015 and no fix seems to exist, even though it's literally a few lines.

This PR rewrites `NppParameters::getSpecialFolderLocation`, improving upon a few things in this function:

1. Logic simplified overall - `SHGetSpecialFolderLocation` is deprecated, and the only use for the obtained `PIDL ` was to get a path to this folder - so by replacing it with `SHGetFolderPath` we achieve the same result with less code.
2. Fixed a memory leak - as noted in the documentation (and the issue linked), `SHGetSpecialFolderLocation` requires its output param to be freed with `CoTaskMemFree`. Now we don't need to worry about this.
3. Made the function have a single return point - this makes it eligible for NRVO optimization. I realize it's not going to gain anything since it's a simple and rarely used function, but if it was being rewritten anyway... then why not?

Sorry @milipili for kind of hijacking the issue, but I figured it's abandoned after 2.5 years.

This is a de facto re-issue of #4077. I remade the PR after #4034 was merged. This time, however, I went ahead and extracted the common part of reloadBuffer and loadFile into a separate function.

My main reasoning behind that is code duplication - notice that if that logic was separate, this issue would not have existed in the first place! loadFile must have had its functionality expanded at some point, but reloadBuffer was left as is. I think extracting it to a separate function will ease maintenance.

This PR mirrors encoding/EOL detection present in `FileManager::loadFile` to `FileManager::reloadBuffer`. As a result, I observed following issues when reloading files modified outside of Notepad++ are fixed:

Since the HTML and XML lexer are the same, it treats `<script>` tags specially since HTML can embed code. The HTML lexer has a `"lexer.xml.allow.scripts"` property that should be used for XML to keep it from trying to parse embedded code. See this section within the HTML Lexer:

This PR adds a hook to the GetOpenFilename dialog box in order to normalize forward-slashes into back-slashes. This is useful, for example, when pasting paths from cross platform-oriented software which often defaults to displaying forward-slash paths (most often for me, CMake).

The downside is that setting `lpfnHook` causes the "Open File" dialog to [revert from Vista-style to XP-style](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/176#issuecomment-112815729). The only way around this is to use the Common Item Dialog boxes.

As seen, a one off issue caused the last line character to be replaced by null terminator in the call to `getGenericText` (said function uses `_tcsncpy_s` with `_TRUNCATE` parameter which forces null terminator to be added if buffer is not large enough). Since provided buffer can store as many characters as the line has, null terminator replaces the last character in the line - and that prevents further parts of the code from detecting closing comment tags properly.

Hi,

I'm new to making contribution to open source projects, so please correct me If I'm doing something wrong.

I started looking into [this issue (#3780)](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/3780).

Main change is replacing Semaphore with Event as a way to do notifications for `CReadDirectoryChanges`.

Please take a look into changes. I did not learn the codebase, only the code around the crash, so maybe there is some deeper problem I did not noticed.

Thank you

A few of the markup uses tab indentation instead of spaces and will display misaligned on viewers doesn't consider tab characters as certain space characters width, replace them with space indentation of the rest of the markup to fix this issue.

This patch is NOT tested as it is done on a Linux laptop ;), please review before merging.

**Root Cause:**
When setting for javascript.js is changed to use tabs instead of spaces, lang.xml is written as below - 

``` <Language name="javascript.js" ext="js jsm jsx ts tsx" commentLine="//" commentStart="/*" commentEnd="*/" tabSettings="-1"> ```

When next time npp is opened, below statment cause problem as tab width can't be set negative.

Most menu items are verbs. For example, in the English version:
`43001:	Find...` – verb
`43002:	Find Next` – verb
`43003:	Replace...` – verb
but in the Russian version these items (translate back into English):
`43001:	Find...` – verb
`43002:	Search more` – verb
`43003:	Replacing...` – noun!
That is, some menu items do not correspond to the general style. This also complicates the perception, and looks unprofessional. In the proposed - an attempt to lead to a unified style.

Notepad_plus::switchEditViewTo() method now does not call notifyBufferActivated() always - only if it detects that the buffer we are switching to in other view is actually different than current one. Assumption is that we don't really need to activate the buffer if it is already active, so in that case we can skip some potentially lengthy operations - like Function list recompiling. In that case, we can just invalidate rects for active and inactive view to update the colors of the tab controls.

### Updated file "NppIO.cpp" to deal with issue #3553 
However both existing and updated code looks same, but it is not.
```command(IDM_VIEW_MONITORING);```
looks equal to 
```
buf->stopMonitoring();
checkMenuItem(IDM_VIEW_MONITORING, false);
_toolBar.setCheck(IDM_VIEW_MONITORING, false);
buf->setUserReadOnly(false);
```
Updated code works on the current file being processed while existing code ```command(IDM_VIEW_MONITORING);``` works with current active buffer. Debugging for reported case can help to understand the above statement.

### Justification for updating file "NppCommands.cpp":
See ```static HANDLE hThread``` gets a handle when monitoring is activated on a tab.
This handle is overwritten if monitoring is activated on another tab. _**Resource leak happens here as previous handle can't be closed at all**_.
However, this handle is not used anywhere in the code, then just why not to close the handle as soon thread is created.

In order to activate a new feature, select "**Multiple Result Tabs**" in the Preference "Search Option".
If this option is **not selected**, the PR is not active and there is an **old behavior** with only one search result.

I think it's much easier to support single Visual Studio project instead of multiple VS  version dedicated projects.

That PR I believe makes notepadPlus.vs2015.vcxproj not needed (required changes were combined). To work with VS 2017 #3488 needs to be merged.

It works for me with VS 2015 and VS 2017. I don't have VS 2013 but it works with AppVeyor build based on VS 2013 image.

Summary of changes:
1) Added calculated NppVsPlatformToolset property. Needs to be updated for each new  VS version with proper PlatformToolset:
```xml
<!--VS 2017 -->
<NppVsPlatformToolset Condition="$(VisualStudioVersion) == '15.0'">v141_xp</NppVsPlatformToolset>
```
2) Added  VS 2015+ specifics from notepadPlus.vs2015.vcxproj  (suppress some warnings and added _CRT_NON_CONFORMING_WCSTOK preprocessor definitions);
3) Added some missing files;

## **It is a very useful feature when you need to search , as I do, many times every day in a existing code or text files and **switch** between the **results of your searches**. The results are presented at the bottom as search named tabs.**
This is an extension of finders, the **presentation of the  multiple search results of "Find" and "Find in Files" in the separate tabs**.
The finder tabs have names, which are the names of the searches.
In order to use this feature, the  **only one finder** option should not be selected in the   **Find and Find in Files dialog**.

Four options are added:

1. "**Only one finder**"Implements the old behavior if this option is selected, it creates and maintains only one finder and replace it every time when there are new "Find all" or "Find in Files" searches.
 The "Same name merge" and "Close empty" options are grayed out as not accessible, implementing an old behavior, except that you can still choose if you want to see the result line several times if the search string is found several times in the line.
**The default is false.**
![onlyonefindermultiplefinders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22246814/27659378-1923b1ce-5c08-11e7-8060-caa340dd98b9.gif)
2. **"Same name merge**" If selected when "Only one finder" is false, it replaces existing finder tab with a new result of search with the same name. If not selected, the results of the same search creates additional result tab, which can be useful if you search the same string in the different directories.
**The default is true.**
![samenamemergemultiplefinders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22246814/27659775-95b8ecbc-5c09-11e7-880d-35c55479d5fe.gif)
Previous search result tab "shut" is close upon a new search and a new search result tab is open

3. "**Close empty**" closes all finders with 0 finds on the next search. 
**The default is true**

4. "**Show line once**" shows only one line of code in finder, if there are multiple finds in the same line. To show the result line once can be useful when you are writing a documentation and need to copy the results
**The default is true.**

Using WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW does not make sense if the windows are dialog boxes. It is not needed at all.

In Windows 10 it is even worse: dialog windows using this style don't have a border (even if they are resizable) - so the "find" or "setting" dialogs for example will just be a plain white rectangle in front of a white text editor background - very confusing.

It is also confusing when some regular windows have smaller title bars due to the WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW style and others don't.

This PR fixes a potential memory leak found by the static code analysis tool [Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/devinfo/).

The potential memory leak happens, because new (by default) never returns a nullptr and therefore, the if-branch gets never executed. In order to catch memory allocation issues in C++, use try-catch or use (std::nothrow).

To overcome this issue, there are few ways:
1. Move code from function "copyCommonFiles" to section "mainSection" instead of calling "copyCommonFiles". **This is recommended way.**
2. Do not show required size at all.
3. or set size of section "mainSection" manually.
This PR uses third approach due to less code.

Currently to interact with Scintilla, Notepad++ uses the `execute()` call which requires lots of casting and is not able to provide any type checking for what gets passed in. There are also numerous inconsistencies about variable types. For example to represent a "position" within a document, Notepad++ uses a variety of types, such as `size_t`, `long`, `int32_t`, `int`, and `LRESULT` with no real reason why. Scintilla only uses a small set of data types so most of the data that gets passed to Scintilla gets `static_cast<>()` immediately.

This PR adds a thin layer (most likely optimized away) which provides a readable and strongly typed interface for interacting with Scintilla. This PR is broken up into multiple commits for easier review. The first commit simply adds the interface. The 2nd and 3rd updates and cleans up the ScintillaEditView to utilize this interface, and the last replaces nearly all other calls to `execute()` with its alternative.

### About the Interface

Each call to Scintilla (e.g. `SCI_XXX`) has an associated method that makes the code readable and enforces correct variable types. For example:

```cpp
void AddText(int length, const char* text) const
{
    execute(SCI_ADDTEXT, length, text);
}
```

Some calls are also overloaded to accept `std::string`s such as:

```cpp
void AddText(const std::string& text) const
{
    execute(SCI_ADDTEXT, text.length(), text.c_str());
}
```

In other cases it is also able to allocate strings as return types (which avoids potential pitfalls such as buffer overruns):

```cpp
int GetText(int length, char* text) const
{
    sptr_t res = execute(SCI_GETTEXT, length, text);
    return static_cast<int>(res);
}

std::string GetText() const
{
    auto size = execute(SCI_GETTEXT, SCI_UNUSED, NULL);
    std::string text(size + 1, '\0');
    execute(SCI_GETTEXT, text.length(), &text[0]);
    trim(text);
    return text;
}
```

This interface can be generated with a Python script (which I can provide later) by reading the scintilla.iface file. This does away with quite a bit of casting when using the ScintillaEditView (other than casting `size_t` to `int` in places). 

I've attempted to make the minimum number of changes to use this interface throughout the code base. I'm hoping this will lead to more cleanup later by providing a cleaner way of getting data into and out of Scintilla.

---

Since this is a non-trivial code patch I am open to idea/feedback/comments/issues and hope that this gets thoroughly reviewed and tested by anyone willing.

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
Issue:

1. Controls on preference (MISC) were overlapped due to newly added controls.
2. Tab order was not proper.
3. Changed phrase from "Snapshot on map" to "Snapshot on document map" as it is bit confusing what/which map.

Fixed issue displaying auto complete dialog when typing a defined additionalWordChar.

For example if auto complete list contains:
object
object.something
object.somethingelse

Then you configure your APIs\language.xml with additionalWordChar="." the dialog will not display when pressing "period" if you already selected "object" from the auto complete.

This update will add the characters defined in the language.xml to the current word characters list before displaying the autocomplete dialog then default back to the configured word characters list.

I did it this way so I could avoid putting the character in Notepad++ configuration for word character list.  This way auto complete will still display but if I double click a word in notepad++ it will not include the periods in the selection.
-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
Updated autocomplete to respect the IgnoreCase flag of the APIs\Language.xml file when populating and sorting the auto complete word list.

The Auto complete dialog would sort words uppercase first regardless of the ignore case flag.  This can cause the dialog to prematurely close sometimes when typing an auto complete keyword.

For Example using the default for vb.xml if you type "appli" once "i" is pressed the dialog closes even though "application" is in the auto complete dialog.

Any TeX-based keyword has a backslash / (such as /starttex and /endtex ) in front of them. The current version of NPP is not identifying a backslash for either extracting words or showing the list. This PR added the feature of the following:

1. These changes are specific to TeX files ending with '.tex';
2. Autocompletion keywords only show up when there is a / in front the typed word;
3. getWordArray ignores keywords that do not start with a /

Fixes issue: #2896, #2979, #3014 

I found two ways to fix these issues.
1. Updating NSIS script
2. Updating Npp source code
        a) From installer launch npp with some parameter such as -install or /install (notice that it will elevated)
        b) If this parameter is seen, then launch npp as non elevated process. This can be achieved by grabbing access token from desktop shell, then duplicate this token and create new npp process using this token.

This PR uses method 1. If Method 2 sounds good, let me know I will update the PR.

There have been reports of the wordchar list getting unexpected characters (see #3137, #3105, #3100, [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/13568/double-click-selects-into-previous-line), [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/13509/sci_wordleft-and-sci_wordright-treats-sentences-as-words-in-new-file/2), [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/13593/inconsistent-double-click-selection-of-quoted-text)). Though I can't say for certain this PR will fix those bugs since I can't consistently reproduce the issue. Either way this still is a potential buffer overrun that needs fixed.

English: "Language" has been translated to spanish as "idioma", but "idioma" is not related with "language" (of programming). The correct translation is "Lenguaje" (de programación). In my free times, maybe I could help with the translating (I don't know how to recognise a button in the UI in this file, yet).

Español: "Language" ha sido traducido al español como "idioma". Esta es la traducción literal, pero en ese contexto el programa se refiere a "Language" (of programming), por lo que la traducción correcta en este caso sería "Lenguaje" (de programación).

The style at the position was reported has having all the higher bits set for some reason, thus when checking if it was a hotspot it was always false. For example the style at the position is reported as:

`4294967168 = 0b11111111111111111111111110000000`

However the styles are only 1 byte worth of data. I'm not sure why the higher bits are being set (possible due to using deprecated API calls) but this solves the immediate issue.

This should do it now. Fixes the crash that occurs when a user holds down RMB and uses mouse wheel to scroll through document list. Also fixes the document list window size to prevent display overflow and ensures that the selected document item is visible. The patch includes an os version check and only forwards the mouse wheel messages on windows 10 to prevent duplicates getting through. I've tested on Win7, Win 7 embedded, Win 8.1 and Win 10.
-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
Sorts out the following:

1. Crash caused by scroll wheel + RMB selecting document in task list dialog
2. Direction of the scrolling in response to the mouse wheel that was present in previous patch attempts
3. Ensures that the item selected in the task list using either the mouse wheel or Ctrl + TAB is visible. This appears to be an unreported bug where a large number of files causes the task list to overflow the display height and hidden items are never shown even when selected.  

@SinghRajenM the dialog is always destroyed when the user selects a file in the task list and re-created, so I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding what you were saying but I can't see any issue with direction being only set once in this latest patch.
-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
As SinghRajenM correctly pointed out, my initial prognosis was incorrect and the issue is not caused by a timing issue between dialog initialization and the parent window. I stand by the _instanceCount member variable as a means to prevent subsequent dialog create calls, but this patch contains additional code to ensure that WM_MOUSEHWEEL messages are handled in the mouse hook and routed to the tasklist - this prevents the regressed user experience.
-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
The application crashes when the user clicks the right mouse button and then scrolls back and forth between the list of files. The problem is caused by additional mouse wheel messages landing in the message queue before the dialog window has been completely initialized and is able to handle messages. As a result the main application window creates multiple TaskListDlg's which eventually leads to a stack overflow. The fix uses a static member variable in TaskListDlg to track the number of instances. This allows the main application window to check the static variable and only create the dialog window if there are no instances. This fix should then also address issues #1619, #2603 and #607 however this has to be confirmed.

Original code was flawed:
 * On +S+H (hidden and system) files, the attributes are set 4 times, when there's only need for 2 calls.
 * When clearing +S bit, it is masked out from the _original_ attribute value, which means that if the +H was cleared previously, it is set back again. It doesn't seem like this was intended, so I assume it's a bug.
 * When restoring the attributes, there's a pointless OR operation.

When you right click on a file name and select 'Open File', it would previously only look at the selected text or the current word. This change makes it try to find the full path. For example, these all open correctly now:

C:\path\to\file\file.txt
(C:\path\to\file\file.txt:1920)
   [d9c.0.47c] TRACE: Calling C:\path\to\file\file.txt(148):some text

Previously you had to select the path and file name before selecting 'open file' otherwise it only opened 'file.txt'.

**While breaking single nsi file into multiple nis (or nsh) files, a regression happened.**
User is not able to install desired language(s) on system while selecting under localization (in install options). However, he/she can install only one preferred locale (along with English) from first page, but cann't install multiple languages from install option.

Root Cause:
langs.nsh is included (in nppSetup.nsi) just before .onInit. Therefore, SectionGroup "Localization" localization is executed right after .onInit, while all the locale xmls are packed in function copyCommonFiles (in mainSectionFuncs.nsh) which comes later in the sequence.
```nsi
; Copy all the language files to the temp directory
	; than make them installed via option
	SetOutPath "$PLUGINSDIR\nppLocalization\"
	File ".\nativeLang\"
```
Resolution:
Break "langs.nsh" into two parts (langs.nsh and langs2.nsh). File "langs.nsh" include only the part which is being used to show the language to installation process and file "langs2.nsh" is being used to copy to selected languages.

Not sure whether a PR is correct way to discuss a issue/solution, but wanted to discuss an issue about drag n drop. Many issues have been reported that drag n drop is not working. In most of the cases, explorer integrity is lower then Notepad++ integrity.

Now in Win10 default integrity level of explorer is lower (non-elevated) and there are many cases when Notepad++ may be running as elevated process.
- case 1: right after installation (it is fixed in one of my PR)
- case 2: If saving a file fails then Npp is relaunched in admin mode
- case 3: user may launch in admin launch
So in all these cases, NPP will not able to support drag n drop.

As per MSDN and related blogs/articles, drag n drop is not supported if processes integrity level is different. It is blocked by User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI). So we can bypass UIPI for certain messages using ChangeWindowMessageFilter/ChangeWindowMessageFilterEX.

I see, there already exists a code to open a file which comes from context menu of Lower Integrity Level explorer while npp is running at higher integrity level. So we should handle drag n drop in same fashion, shouldn't we.

 ``` C++
// Tell UAC that lower integrity processes are allowed to send WM_COPYDATA messages to this process (or window)
// This allows opening new files to already opened elevated Notepad++ process via explorer context menu.
if (ver >= WV_VISTA || ver == WV_UNKNOWN)
{
	HMODULE hDll = GetModuleHandle(TEXT("user32.dll"));
	if (hDll)
	{
		// According to MSDN ChangeWindowMessageFilter may not be supported in future versions of Windows,
		// that is why we use ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx if it is available (windows version >= Win7).
		if (pNppParameters->getWinVersion() == WV_VISTA)
		{
			typedef BOOL(WINAPI *MESSAGEFILTERFUNC)(UINT message, DWORD dwFlag);
			const DWORD MSGFLT_ADD = 1;

			MESSAGEFILTERFUNC func = (MESSAGEFILTERFUNC)::GetProcAddress(hDll, "ChangeWindowMessageFilter");

			if (func)
				func(WM_COPYDATA, MSGFLT_ADD);
		}
		else
		{
			typedef BOOL(WINAPI *MESSAGEFILTERFUNCEX)(HWND hWnd, UINT message, DWORD action, VOID* pChangeFilterStruct);
			const DWORD MSGFLT_ALLOW = 1;

			MESSAGEFILTERFUNCEX func = (MESSAGEFILTERFUNCEX)::GetProcAddress(hDll, "ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx");

			if (func)
				func(notepad_plus_plus.getHSelf(), WM_COPYDATA, MSGFLT_ALLOW, NULL);
		}
	}
}
```

This way we can process WM_DROPFILES message as well. So with updated code (present in this PR) npp works exact same as non-elevated except one point. Still drag n drop is not allowed on scintilla edit view (editable portion).

I couldn't find way to handle it. If someone has any idea, it can be improved.
Also I'm not sure about undocumented message 0x0049, but without it given solution does not work.

Copy some code from `FileManager::loadFile` to `reloadBuffer`, to fix two bugs also when reloading file from disk. I think the bug 1 is quite important, as it affects "reload from disk" in a very common scenario (ANSI-only content, but force-detected as UTF-8 without BOM).

Bug 1:
1. The settings "New Document > UTF-8 + Apply to opened ANSI files" should be checked.
2. Create a file with only ANSI content (e.g. "aaa"). Save this file in ANSI. Close the file.
3. Open the file. It should be detected as UTF-8 (without BOM).
4. Execute menu command "Reload from Disk". The file is now detected as ANSI. Expected: should be detected as UTF-8.

Bug 2:
1. Create a file with this exact content:
    `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"> ééé`
2. Save it in ANSI and with a `.html` extension. Close the file.
3. Open the file. It should be detected as UTF-8 (and display garbage but that's "expected").
4. Execute command "Reload from Disk". The file is now detected as Windows-1255. Expected: should be detected as UTF-8.

<br>By the way, maybe we should drop the `getHtmlXmlEncoding` method. For instance look at the HTML regexes, they are outdated (no html5), not flexible and in most cases wouldn't match. Also, I think this method does more harm than good. These &lt;meta&gt; tags don't determine the file encoding, but the *expected* file encoding.

<br>About the JavaScript regex:

Current:
`function(\s+[A-Za-z_]?\w*\([^\)\(]*\)|\([^\)\(]*\))`

There are 2 parts, for named and anonymous functions. Note there is some duplication, let's simplify it:
`function(\s+[A-Za-z_]?\w*)?\([^\)\(]*\)`

The first character of function name is not optional (of course when the function is named), let's fix it:
`function(\s+[A-Za-z_]\w*)?\([^\)\(]*\)`

Finally let's support the possible spaces before opening parenthesis, for both named and anonymous functions:
`function(\s+[A-Za-z_]\w*)?\s*\([^\)\(]*\)`

Previously there was duplication of code (which had problems) which tried to determine the URL at the double click location. This still lets `addHotSpot()` do the hard work of determining what should be a hotspot, but just uses the style information instead of trying to re-locate the URL with a regex.

 - Use DWORD instead of string for Minor and major version
     As per [nsis documentation](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Add_uninstall_information_to_Add/Remove_Programs), VersionMajor and VersionMinor should be DWORD.
 - Show only "Uninstall" instead of "Uninstall/Change". Refer the screenshot.
    Currently npp installer does not support modify/repair feature. It is better to show only "Uninstall" in  "Program and Features". As per [nsis documentation](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Add_uninstall_information_to_Add/Remove_Programs), If both NoModify and NoRepair are set to 1, the button displays "Remove" instead of "Modify/Remove".
 - Write installed size as well which will be shown in "Program and Features". Refer the screenshot.
 As per [nsis documentation](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Add_uninstall_information_to_Add/Remove_Programs), It's strongly recommended to include an EstimatedSize field in unninstall entry. Moreover it is nice to show total installation size.

Something went wrong while breaking nppSetup.nsi (6.9.2 to 7.0) to multiple files.

 Closes #2346

The root cause of #2346 is a non-existing directory, and then the function returned false which aborted the save. This addresses the issue along with a few other tweaks:
- Ensures the _full_ directory exists. Just calling `CreateDirectory()` is not sufficient since multiple sub folders may not exist.
- Failed backups result in a user error message but asks to save the current file anyways.
- Applies to both simple and verbose backups.
- Simplifies logic within `fileSave()` when figuring out where to save backups.

The new error message looks like this:

Current Notepad++ installer just leaves almost all the files (used in installation) in the %temp% folder. I feel that Notepad++ should remove these files post installation.
Use $PLUGINSDIR instead of $TEMP. The $PLUGINSDIR keyword points to the temp dir created by the InitPluginsDir macro, usually %temp%\nsXXX.tmp. This directory (%temp%\nsXXX.tmp) is removed once installation is over.

Closes #2413

This adds C# [contextual keywords](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x53a06bb.aspx#Anchor_0). As discussed in the referenced issue, these words aren't actually _reserved_ keywords. Meaning that in some contexts they are not actually keywords. Since the C# lexer is not able to distinguish whey they are contextually appropriate, it will _always_ highlight them. I feel it would be rare to actually see these contextual keywords elsewhere in source code (I would assume it is best practice not to use them anyways). If there are objects to adding all of these contextual keywords in fear it may inappropriately highlight words, then I'd suggest at least adding a subset of them.

The "TYPE WORD" list for C# was not edit-able from the style configurator. (The lexer still worked fine though). This is now added to all themes.

Few folders and files are not cleared.
From InstallDir
    1. Folder "localization" is not removed even all the files are removed.
    2. Folder "pluging\APIs" is not removed even all the files are removed.
    3. Three files are not removed (contextMenu.xml, functionList.xml and shortcuts.xml). There might be more files.
From "%appdata%\Notepad"
    1. Bakcup folder (%appdata%) is not removed if backup folder is not empty.
    2. Folder "themes" is not removed even all the files are removed.
    3. Because of above two items, parent folder ("%appdata%\Notepad") is also not removed.

This changes fixes below issues - 
1. On Win7 the url control (both hyperlink and number dialog) flickers. Handling WM_SETCURSOR messge resolves this issue. I'm not sure why case WM_SETCURSOR: was commented. @donho , must be knowing if there is any history behind commenting WM_SETCURSOR message.
2. By default the control takes the length as defined in the resource. However, at many places the length of control exceed the length of the string which allows user to select url/dialog from other area as well.

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
Added 'quick find' functionality to search dialog.
Enabled by default, not saved in settings.
When search dialog is opened writing something in search box will search and mark all matches in current document.
Toggling any control on search tab will reset the search, as well as changing search combo box selection.
When search dialog is closed all marks are removed.

1. In notepad++ APIs folder there is vb.xml, it contains keywords which has space character in name value
for example `<KeyWord name="If Then Else" />`. 

To reproduce the bug: 
open new document
Goto Language and choose Visual Basic
start typing `If` autocomplete box will shows `If` `Then` `Else` in separate line
while the expected behavior is to show in single line

2. Similarly, Autocompete box only shows the list of the values which matches the case of the input value
while the expected behavior is to ignore case.

Now even if we put  `<Environment ignoreCase="yes" >` (taken reference from c.xml) in vb.xml, this behavior is not changed.

By  default quick search is enabled. When find windows is opened writing something in search box will search and mark all matches in current document, jumping to first match from beginning (focus will stay on the search box). Working algorithm is a combination of "find next" + "mark all" features. Clicking "whole words only" or "case senstive" will reset search (if quick find checkbox is set). Checkbox and quick find work only in "find in document" tab.

Now it checks the plugin to see if it is 32 or 64-bit and provides a better error message. I also slightly tweaked the strings, and added the plugin name to the message, since the full path at the top can cut of the actual plugin name.

- Improved argument detection and extended usage section accordingly.
- Corrected Boost build tool property for 64-bit builds i.e. using `address-model=64` instead of `architecture=ia64`. The `architecture=ia64`-property is intended for targets with an Itanium processor architecture which no one has (most probably). See also the '64-bit support'-section at http://www.boost.org/build/doc/html/bbv2/reference/tools.html
- Simplified Boost version detection i.e. get it directly from source, `getboostver.*`-files no longer needed.
- Replaced obsolete SourceForge forum link with Community forum link.
- Using for-loop to guess the used build tool set.
- Simplified library path assignment.

- Changed order of associations and parsers to follow ascending 'langID' numerical values.
- Removed `displayMode` attributes (are not used).
- Make functionList.xml XML compliant.
- Put set of characters in same order in all character groups.
- Correct `)/` to `/)` in `commentExpr`-attribute.
- Add pattern modifier to multi-line comment expression.
- Add pattern modifier to single-line comment expression.
- When applicable remove outer most parentheses of `commentExpr`-attribute.
- As an underscore is part of character class `\w` (equals group `[A-Za-z0-9_]`) remove the underscore when both are used in the same group.
- Replace the `A-Za-z0-9_` set in a group with character class `\w` as they are equal.
- No need to put one character class in a group e.g. change `[\w]` to `\w`.
- Replace space character with its hexdecimal representation i.e. `\x20`.
- Corrected Python parser i.e. renamed `funcNameExpr` to `nameExpr` in function-parser part.
- Changed use of `L_JS` (19) to `L_JAVASCRIPT` (58).

1. Remove only 64 bit uninstaller related registry while installing 64 bit Npp
2. Removed duplicate code for context menu
3. Use ExecWait instead of Exec to deregister the contextMenuDll

This change is specially for #1, consider a scenario where both the current versions (32 and 64) are installed and user uninstalls 64 bit version, then 32 bit version can't be uninstalled (via control panel), as 32 bit registries were also deleted. To avoid this, SetRegView 64 for 64bit uninstaller (similar to 64 bit installer), So only 64 bit uninstaller related registry will be deleted.

Current Notepad++ installer just leaves almost all the files (used in installation) in the %temp% folder. I feel that Notepad++ should remove these files post installation.
Use $PLUGINSDIR instead of $TEMP. The $PLUGINSDIR keyword points to the temp dir created by the InitPluginsDir macro, usually %temp%\nsXXX.tmp. This directory (%temp%\nsXXX.tmp) is removed once installation is over.

Issue #2221 
 It's my first PR so please give me some information if there is something wrong with it. I implemented drag-n-drop functionality to rearrange  list's elements in vertical file switcher. It works for multiple files at the same time.  I had some problems with restoring selected state for dragged items and I figured out that best way will be to use drophilted state to mark all moved items and after moving them restore selected state for all items with drophilted state. Current implementation supports only rearranging items but it could be extended easily to adopt moving files to new window etc.

Closes #2038 

Currently there are inconsistencies when using EOL terminology. I have changed occurrences to use (and maintain this order):
- `Windows (CR LF)`
- `Unix (LF)`
- `Macintosh (CR)`

I am open to suggestions but I feel this is fairly straight forward, unambiguous, and this is exactly how MSVC displays them in their menu.

Fixes #1329. This adds a thousands separator to the Summary window and the Statusbar. When the numbers are more then a few digits it is very hard to read. Especially with 64bit presumably going to handle larger files, this is very user friendly.

Before merging I would like a bit of feed back. First of all, the separator is based on locale, and for my locale it uses a comma, for others it may use an apostrophe (or nothing at all). I'd be curious how other locales handle this exactly. (If need be I think it can be forced to use a particular character.)

Also, I'm no expert for ensuring 64bit compatibility. In a few cases `static_cast<>()` is used which I'm not sure is applicable (I just kept it since it was already there). Also the `commafyInt()` function currently just takes a `size_t`. I'm not sure if it would be best to do something like make this a template function or something.

Hello,

First of all, thank you for that awesome tool!

I'm suggesting to add a new NPPM message that would allow the plugins to programmatically disable the auto-completion from showing when characters are added to the text (basically it would act like the user unchecked _Enable auto-completion on each input_).

This would allow plugins to implement custom auto-completion for certain type of files (disabling the default Npp auto-completion) while maintaining the option checked for the user so the default auto-completion can still be used on other files.

Thank you for your consideration ;)

Added some more Change Case functions (Title Case, Sentence Case, Invertcase, Randomcase).
Some of them have a normal and a blend version. The normal version will change any formatting in the start/middle/end part of the word/sentence to the chosen case. The blend version applies the changes only to the start part but don't changes the middle/end part of the word/sentence. You can use it when you want to keep some formatting in the middle/end part, for instance CamelCase or proper nouns.

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
Improved the Single Line Comment/Uncomment/Toggle behaviour for Lexers with the following condition:

```
Single Line Comment Symbol  :  false
Stream Comment Symbol Start :  true
Stream Comment Symbol End   :  true
```

This includes among others: XML, HTML, CSS, Caml, Pascal, ...

In the current Npp a 'Single Line Comment' will do a 'Block Comment' and the 'Toggle Single Line Comment' entry does nothing at all for these kind of Lexers.

This implementation uses the stream comment symbols (start/end) to accomplish a single line comment,
exactly the same way as the usual Single Line Comment/Uncomment/Toggle functionality does for Lexers with a single line symbol.
This will add more consistency to the Single Line Comment feature.

NOTE
The selection range behaviour has been revised to be more accurate and for fixing some 'line leaving' bugs when uncommenting.

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
Added a new command variable $(NPP_ROOT_DIRECTORY), for a more portable configuration of Run Commands.

NPP_ROOT_DIRECTORY contains the path to the parent directory (NppRoot) of the Npp directory, for instance:

| Variable | Content |
| --- | --- |
| FullNppPath1 | [NppRoot]\Notepad++\Notepad++.exe |
| NPP_DIRECTORY | [NppRoot]\Notepad++ |
| NPP_ROOT_DIRECTORY | [NppRoot] |
| FullNppPath2 | C:\Notepad++.exe |
| Both | C:\ |

When you have some portable applications in a movable path ([X]\App1\; [X]\App2\; [X]\Notepad++),
this will make the configuration straightforward:

$(NPP_ROOT_DIRECTORY)\App1\App1.exe [params]
$(NPP_ROOT_DIRECTORY)\App2\App2.exe [params]

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
Added a basic conflict detection functionality to the Shortcut Mapper. This includes:
- Marking conflicts with a different background color.
- Displaying conflict information.
- Warning when attempting to assign an already existing short-key.

Some more related changes to the Shortcut Mapper:
- Fixed some bugs, for instance:
  - Babygrid was shrinking on any attempt to adjust its position to integral rows.
  - Context menu entries were enabled for empty lists. Using them would crash Npp.
  - ... some more minor bug fixes.
- Performance enhancements to Babygrid.
- Minor UI improvements.
- Babygrid is configured dpi aware.

As requested in issue #1739 

I realize the issue has not been 'accepted' yet. However if you decide to accept the issue, this code realizes the requested behavior.
The solution temporarily overwrites _options._whichDirection, because the variable _options is passed to processFindNext. It is set back to the original value after the call.
An alternative is to copy the whole _options variable into a new variable and modify that one. That way, you don't have to set the original value again. It's safer for exceptions, but requires a copy. Because it looks like raised exceptions here immediately stop the program anyway, I chose the first option.

, tested with the attached https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/files/278989/practice.txt, after rename to xml on 6.9.2, crash happens due to out-of-bounds access to imported keyword list entry > max_char corrupting _keywordLists of _userLangArray

@donho: 
- not fixed is the part for UDL import pre 2.0. Is this still relevant?
- problematic input is just replaced by a hardcoded error text, is it necessary to have the keyword input limited to max_char or could we use the dynamic generic_string instead?
  e.g. 
  `std::array<generic_string, SCE_USER_KWLIST_TOTAL> _keywordLists;`
  instead of 
  `TCHAR _keywordLists[SCE_USER_KWLIST_TOTAL][max_char];`, see https://github.com/chcg/notepad-plus-plus/commit/2769a86538ce2bb94ccab0db64a2622ef49d99d2 for a first impl
- seems that the UDL import can't report a failure from NppParameters::feedUserKeywordList(), ...further import helper.

x64 build is broken since inital checkin of feature file browser 

https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/a1c608ba611e60dfdb5f194a9de4abcd38d73bb4
- Should be possible to add also a appveyor buildtarget for that to check x64 build is also ok.
- Maybe VS2015 is also relevant and should be checked via appveyor buildtarget 
- a buildtarget with VS code analysis feature enabled might be also worth a look

Implementation of issue #1542.

There are two commits in this pull request:
- One commit that actually implements the feature: There is now an entry in the file menu to open a folder as workspace (it basically adds the folder to the list as if you would it through the context menu of the file browser window). Additionally, it is ensured that the file browser is visible afterwards.
- One commit that fixes two bugs: When dropping a folder to the application window, this folder is added to the root folders of file browser (workspace). There were, however, a critical and a minor flaw when the folder was dropped if the file browser window was not visible. If the file browser has not been opened so far in the current session, all previously stored root folders were lost (critical). If it was already open at least once before, the UI checkmarks were not in a consistent state (minor).

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
Implementation of issue #944.

In the preferences dialog, the new option can be found in the document switcher group box. To fit all the controls onto the dialog page, I needed to move some checkboxes slightly (decreased the distance between them from 15 to 13 pixels).
Implemented reading from and writing to the GUI parameters in the config xml file.
As suggested by @ccompletion, the file name is displayed in red color if the diskette icon is not shown (to be able to distinguish unsaved files).

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
I discovered this open issue and implemented it. The change was quite straightforward. I renamed the identifiers of the menu entries to make the distinction between user and file read-only flag more obvious. I also made the checkmark of the user read-only flag in the file menu behave consistently with the one in the context menu of the file tab (noticeable in the case when the user and the file read-only flag are set).

Add autocompletion file for the amazing [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) software, which is already supported in syntax highlighting.

File directly taken from directory `Extras\Editors\Notepad++` of their release package. I only replaced the single quotes by double quotes for consistency with the other autocompletion files, and made sure this change didn't break anything.

I searched the author of this substantial file for proper credit, but I couldn't find it.

A few minor performance enhancements. Again, it is difficult to create an issue for this so hopefully this can be discussed here. Some comments about each commit:
- 00237d9 Scintilla can automatically handle some folding. Notepad++ can take advantage of some of it using [SCI_SETAUTOMATICFOLD](http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html#SCI_SETAUTOMATICFOLD)
- d0a2bad Fairly straight forward. Use [SCI_SETTARGETRANGE](http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html#SCI_SETTARGETRANGE) where possible instead of manually setting the start and end separately. 
- 083bf48 Some enhancements while compiling the auto completion list. I will make some comments inline to better describe them.

If user performs a "find in files" on a large directory and contents
are either stored on SSD/RAM disk or cached in RAM, frequency of
progress bar and file name updates is so high that it starts to
impact performance of entire search. Reduce it to each percent or
after every 150 ms, so up to ~10% of CPU time may be reclaimed.

when this buffer consists only of "#" char. This causes assertions
to be triggered with debug builds.

When i save a file with "save as" that has a language different from "text" the language is preserved as in the "save" command.
For all new or old files that have "text" default value set as language, the language will be auto detected during the "save as" as before but with the plus of use the fallback value that is obtained from the first row content if the file extension is not detected.
With this approach if I change the extension or I save a new file with certain extension after the change of language, the user set language prevails on the language detected by extension.

See issue #1298 

Another way to do this can be by adding another function to see if the file extension is supported and maintain the current selected language only if new file name has an unknown extension, in case that the new file name has different known extension, the language will be updated using the language associated with the new file extension, changing the previous selected language.

If you want to proceed with this new way, please ignore my PR and I'll start from scratch with this new approach.

Let me know.

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
A few small commits to address some minor tweaks. It isn't easy to create an issue for this PR, so hopefully it can be discussed here.
- 7d3b54e - Scintilla has built in commands to move lines up/down, so this takes advantage of them which I'm sure is a bit more efficient since Scintilla can do it all at once internally instead of multiple calls to `currentLineUp()` etc. 
- d9190d0 - Some checks can be skipped since `SCI_GETSELECTIONSTART` is always the lesser of the two selection endpoints.
- 3b39bc2 - ~~When selecting a section of text Notepad++ would copy the _entire_ selection to count the characters (this can spike memory when editing large files) -- Scintilla can do it internally with the [`SCI_COUNTCHARACTERS`](http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html#SCI_COUNTCHARACTERS) command. **NOTE:**  I've tested this as much as possible but I am not very familiar with the various character encodings,  so hopefully someone can verify this works with different encodings.~~ Removed due to Scintilla bug.

Fix for #1303. I know themes need more updates, but it's still a step ;)

Some explanations about the colors I've chosen:
- OPERATOR: DFC47D rather than 9F9D6D - I think the later isn't contrasted enough.
- CHARACTER: CC9393 rather than DCA3A3 - the later is slightly brighter but it looks the same on the dark background, so let's use the same color for single/double quoted strings.

Therefore, the result is the same as with the JavaScript rules.

2) _Match any selection_
3) _Same as Find dialog_ (follows whatever setting is chosen in the find dialog for "Match whole word only")

The file was refering to PascalCase as camelCase. While these things are usually not set in stone, in camelCase the first letter is lower most (if not all) of the time.

#1125 redux.

So, anyone knows if Windows 8.1 also needs this [specific selection for desktop shortcut](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/3733d971464e5914ded6931c9abd777e81fe9b9b/PowerEditor/installer/nppSetup.nsi#L287)?

I read Windows 8.1 changed many things from Windows 8 concerning the shortcuts (desktop, <del>start menu</del>, start screen...), but I'm not really planning to install it... like, ever.

Features:
Icon tabs are now drawn using windows file icons. If no icon exists, the current floppy disc is used.
Unsaved tabs are drawn with a red overlay. Read-only files are drawn in grayscale.

The drawItem function of TabBar now delegates drawing the image to a function that is overwritten by DocTabView. The default implementation in TabBar keeps the current functionality.

The number of icons that can be added are limited by the max size of IconList, so >nbmax files will use the default icon.

There is a known issue where unsaved icons will appear sightly discolored when closing and reopening the application.

Edit:
Read only files:

Bugfix on PR Fix smarthighlight #187
, see also comments added in the PR.

String returned by SCI_GETWORDCHARS from scintilla is not null terminated, so check for strlen in isWordChar() below on listChar is dangerous as strlen accesses data after the buffer until the first following null is found in memory
- seen with MS Application Verifier on x64 release
- expected to also happen on win32 x86 release
- for debug typically the memory is preallocated with zero, so this issue is maybe not visible for debug builds

- support WM_UNICHAR messages in non-Unicode mode
- fix some code duplication

Also, do not return FALSE upon receiving a WM_UNICHAR message with
a UNICODE_NOCHAR parameter, since WM_UNICHAR can actually be handled
just fine (at least with the exact same level of support as WM_CHAR).

Changes in this PR:
- All positions are dynamically calculated relative to the tab rectangle now (i.e. no hardcoded pixel values are used to position icons/text anymore)
- Match positioning of icons/text in active and inactive tabs (i.e. elements are not "jumping around" anymore upon selection)

I have some more fixes in line, but I first want to make sure the PR will be accepted like this before putting more work into it.

Some specific fixes:
- Most issues with vertical TabBar are resolved now (it was basically unusable before, for example labels were cut)
- Darkened background of inactive tabs fills the whole tab now (fixes #1011)
- Close button is centered correctly now (fixes #1010)

Here are some screenshot for easy comparison of (old ->new) behavior:

When backups are enabled, playing back a macro that takes a while can corrupt a file (see the mentioned issues). I tested this with a ~100,000 line text file, ~3.3MB in size. Created a macro of Down_5, Delete_10. Played this till the end of the file. Took about 20s to run so it had a few backup cycles during it. Reproduced it fairly easily and never had it happen after this adjustment.

Added option to add UDL to Preferences -> Tab settings.

![preferences - tab settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14962885/10269343/066ade70-6ad5-11e5-85ef-5ac0cf636a57.png)

I need to set specific tab settings for ABAP language (defined in UDL). It uses fixed 2 spaces tab setting in code editor (no way to change it there). So I'd like to use _4 Chars / Tab_ for all other languages, and _2 Chars / Space_ for UDL(ABAP). 
Standard way is, that UDL use "[Default]" Tab settings. So I came to first option.

Set "[Default]" as I want it for UDL to _2/Space_, and uncheck _use default value_ for all other languages. Problem was, that if default is _4/Tab_, configuration will revert back which results in checking all languages back to "use default value", as it thinks it's default (_4/Tab_). So no way here. Here I've found workaround for this,  to add to all nodes in file `langs.model.xml` (force) setting for tab `tabSettings="4"`. That way I was able to change settings without reverting back to default value = resulting deletion of `tabSettings="4"` from profile file `langs.xml`. But still it's hard to uncheck everything, and also loosing "[Defalt]" option in the process.

So I look to code a little, did some tests, and found out, that there's better workaround. Add following line to `langs.model.xml` or existing profile file `langs.xml`: `<Language name="udf"/>`
This way it will add option for this language to Preferences, so it's possible to set custom setting for all User Defined Languages. And this way I was able to set it like I need to. To have separated setting for UDL, and yet had default value for all other languages.

As it's working, I think it's good idea to make it usable for all users. It's not like we can have separated setting of Tab for every UDL. Sure we would like to. But at least it's a small step forward.

- Used wider em dash (&mdash;) instead of short hyphen (-) as title parts separator in windows
- For arguments about this see: https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop/pull/707
- It's only an escape sequence. So I ask for reviewing the pull request. I couldn't test it. Does it work this way?

Future:
- As you can read in [the issue of the other repository](https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop/pull/707), it would be the best to have this string localizable

- Fix: when search field is not empty, Function List's background color does not follow Npp theme.
- Fix: close button and textual search box now scale in high-dpi.
- Fix: icons' image not centered in icons' rectangle.
- Fix: when double-clicking the panel's toolbar, it briefly displayed a dialog to customize icons, but we can't use it there.

[Known issues](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/733):
- I couldn't made toolbar icon images scale properly in high-dpi; I imagine they need to be in a ImageList, something I don't know how to use.
- TreeView icons should also be scaled, and I've done it, but they displayed strange gray background, so I decided to leave it as is now.
- It would be better to wrap icons when they don't fit in panel's width, but I don't know how to refresh the toolbar properly.

[UPDATE] Bulgarian language

-D-E-L-I-M-I-T-E-R-
Two new options (three in total):
1. _Remember last search_: will not clear the last typed value, after clicking Go.
2. _Use current position_: it will automatically update input box with the current line/offset.
3. _Clear after Go_: this is the current, now old, behavior.

Also:
- In attention to https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/708, turn "Remember last search" the default behavior. This gives the user more ease to go back to previous location.
- Make input text selected by default when dialog get focus. This improves usability when input is not empty.
- Add missing Alt-key shortcuts to the two buttons.

Todo: add these new options to translation files.

Considering the toolbar is not movable by known means, it doesn't make sense for it to display a gripper.

What I don't understand is why it doesn't work, ie, the toolbar is not movable.
From my research, the gripper appeared in toolbar at version 4.9 (2008)¹, but I couldn't see the toolbar becoming movable. Up to 4.8.5 there was no visible gripper.
¹https://github.com/azabluda/notepad-plus-plus/commit/9e26b31e3ac88276b832ea69c396ea5af3faeb6a

~~I also see we have a whole management around the Gripper ("[Docking Manager](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/tree/master/PowerEditor/src/WinControls/DockingWnd)"). Is this unrelated to the toolbar?~~ (Docking Manager seems related to detachable panels, even though I see many occurrences of the world "toolbar")

@donho I'm sorry about our previous discussion... but could you please clarify this?

The other commit reduces the padding of toolbar slightly, so it looks a bit better, imo.

Yes, this time it was tested. :grin:

Passing through discussion in PR https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/pull/546, which proposed a more complicated solution to keep "new 0" as initial file name, the correct behavior should be "new 1" instead of "new 0" for the initial file name, as it was before, according to @MarkMaldaba at https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/182#issuecomment-118370436:

> This is a regression, not an enhancement. Old versions of Notepad++ (e.g. 6.2.1) would open with "new 1". In the latest version (6.7.9.2) it opens with "new 0". There was obviously a regression introduced somewhere between those two versions. "new 1" is the correct numbering for humans
> https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/182#issuecomment-118370436

This is standard among many programs. Photoshop, for instance, starts with "Untitled-1".

I tracked this issue started at commit https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/85a6d2c05498dc789ff5ab1ac491bcd063e112dd (included in v6.6) which introduced the `nextUntitledNewNumber()` function.

An alternative fix, other than the proposed in my commit, might be changing the same line as below (but with some extra processing):

``` diff
-wsprintf(nb, TEXT("%d"), 0);
+wsprintf(nb, TEXT(" %d"), nextUntitledNewNumber());
```

Resolved an issue where a user could crash N++ if they elected to delete or modify non-existant items in the Shortcut Mapper window (#521).

Also added a scrollable tab bar functionality (added the WM_MOUSEWHEEL event in TabBar.cpp) to allow scrolling of the tabs if there are more open than can be displayed.

Note: I did mean to do 2 separate commits/pull requests to ensure proper upstream integration so if the pulls are accepted and only 1 at a time, that's completely copacetic. 

If I've missed anything or didn't document/comment/debug properly please let me know; I tested the tab scrolling capability in numerous configurations but couldn't test it with a bunch of different mouses unfortunately.

when a user creates a new file, uses user preferences
however when opening an empty file where notepad++ can't detect the line endings, it uses windows line endings

I've proposed a coupe of changes. First noticing that on construction Buffer::_format is set to the users eol preference, theres no need for a default fallback to be set.

1) FileManager::loadFileData sets *pFormat to -1 when it can't detect a line ending (empty file)
2) FileManager::loadFile and FileManager::ReloadBuffer only set the line ending of the buffer when format!=-1, thus uses the users preference

When N++ is deactivated, we should save the currently focused window. When N++ is activated again, we should set focus to the window that we saved.

Problem: there is potentially a race condition between "IsWindow" and "SetFocus".

Test cases:

1.
Open N++.
Open Find dialog.
Make sure the "Find what" textbox is selected.
Alt-Tab out.
Alt-Tab back in.
Expected: "Find what" is still selected.

2.
Open N++.
Open Find dialog.
Now make sure that _Scintilla_ is selected.
Alt-Tab out.
Alt-Tab back in.
Expected: Scintilla is selected (and _not_ "Find what").

f0fa5e74b8afbc92114e489ccd81eaa9b6aed35e caused all hell to break loose, and GitHub wasn't clear about what the problem was. So did b31e213b7ba3121370a82bb27955a12c4cd0ef0c. I decided to close #348, and to forgo the hoop-jumping of another fragile rebase/squash.

Hello @donho 

Glad to see that the project has finally moved to Github. My congratulations!

I just noticed that for some strange reason the [old history](https://github.com/azabluda/notepad-plus-plus/commits/6b0cfa6bb62f0106603a4eb3c32d2e9209793093) (before 2009-04-24) hasn't been imported. So I made a couple of trivial manipulations in Git to bring it back. Unfortunately we can't append it to the bottom of the new history (2009-04-25 and after) without rewriting all further commit hashes, but I suggest at least to merge it into the master tip as a zero-change branch.

Regards,
AZ

Changes , see http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaHistory.html

 Release 3.5.7

```
Released 20 June 2015.
Added SCI_MULTIPLESELECTADDNEXT to add the next occurrence of the main selection within the target to the set of selections as main. If the current selection is empty then select word around caret. SCI_MULTIPLESELECTADDEACH adds each occurrence of the main selection within the target to the set of selections.
SciTE adds "Selection Add Next" and "Selection Add Each" commands to the Search menu.
Added SCI_ISRANGEWORD to determine if the parameters are at the start and end of a word.
Added SCI_TARGETWHOLEDOCUMENT to set the target to the whole document.
Verilog lexer recognises protected regions and the folder folds protected regions.
A performance problem with markers when deleting many lines was fixed. Bug #1733.
On Cocoa fix crash when ScintillaView destroyed if no autocompletion ever displayed. Bug #1728.
On Cocoa fix crash in drag and drop.
On GTK+ 3.4+, when there are both horizontal and vertical scrollbars, draw the lower-right corner so that it does not appear black when text selected. Bug #1611.
Fixed most calls deprecated in GTK+ 3.16. Does not fix style override calls as they are more complex.
SciTE on GTK+ 3.x uses a different technique for highlighting the search strip when there is no match which is more compatible with future and past versions and different themes.

More could be changed and improved to the document, but i think this is a good starting point. More rules should be added, and the reasons for those rules and conventions should be made clear. Perhaps the wiki page may be a better place for these changes.

**Change log:**
Rewrote introduction.
Corrected some markup issues.
Corrected typos, and rewrote some rules for better clarity. The rules meaning have not been changed.
Reordered rules into logical groups, and changed rules from a unordered list to level 4 subheaders.
Rewrote and formatted example headers.
Correct some examples, and added additional examples.

Monitored directories can be added to a project.
Each monitored directory can have multiple search patterns. These search patterns are displayed in the directory and in the info tip. Clearing the search pattern filters for all files. Sub directories, which contain no data matching the pattern, are hidden.
Directories can also be renamed manually.

Implementation details:
The monitoring is done by polling every second.

I don't really like polling, but I tried two other obvious attempts, both of which had severe drawbacks:

FindFirstChangeNotification/FindNextChangeNotification: Did not work very good, because a max of ~60 directories per thread can be handled (64 objects limit of WaitForMultipleObjects). Additionally, it is not very useful when used for full sub trees, because it does not offer details about WHAT was changed.

GetQueuedCompletionStatus/ReadDirectoryChangesW: Worked absolutely perfect in terms of being notified, BUT locked all open directories against deletion, which is definitely not what we want: The feature is mainly thought for directories, which are externally changed, e.g. a Perforce directory of LUA files, which change on every get latest version. It would be completely counterproductive if Perforce would be hindered from deleting directories, because Notepad++ watches it.

The polling itself is quick, because the last write time is checked first.

Every 10 seconds, the visibility of the sub directories is checked.
Since this is a recursive operation (a sub-directory may not be hidden, if a sub-sub-sub-directory contains data), this is a far more time consuming operation. If you add directories with an extreme amount of sub-directories (e.g. C:\Windows\winsxs, it has ~18.000 sub directories on my machine!), a remarkably time is spent by checking these. Nevertheless, monitoring winsxs is not what the project panel is thought for, and for moderately big directories, it works pretty good.

Additionally, there is still some optimization potential for opening directories, which is slow currently for really large directories. Currently, if a directory changes, the directory is read and compared in the watcher thread, then a message is sent, and then its read and compared again in the project panel. It would be better, if the directory contents would be directly sent.

Probably, the monitoring feature and the sub directory visibility feature could be switched by user options. This is prepared, but not tested.

Feedback appreciated.

  - PO Translation files (.po, .pot)
  - POV Ray files (.pov)
  - Windows registry files (.reg, .inf moved from ini lexer entry)
  - added styles for all define entries available in scilexer.h for each new lexer, just a starting point for further more sophisticated work
  - no keyword, etc in langs.model.xml for the new entries, just a starting point for further more sophisticated work
- Added further file extensions for coffeescript files (.coffee, .co, .cakefile)

- Contains further changes necessary for x64 builds in npp code
- added x64 section in npp vcxprj file
- adapted scintilla vcxprj file to be in line with npp one to build from single solution file containing both projects
- further commit adds npps boost regex to scintilla vcxprj file and retrieves boost via nuget
- avoid x64 crashes with user defined lexer, tab resorting
- open issues: 
  - plenty of compiler warnings for x64 due to data loss by automatic casting of data types
  - text is not visible in key shortcut mapper dialog under x64 only, also text is available during debugging and in modify dialog, maybe part of one of the compiler warnings
  - influence on plugins
  - adapt scintilla, npp boostregex nmakes to be x64 ready
  - adapt vs2005 (should be removed according to #121 ) and vs2015 project files to be in sync with vs2013

Hi DonHo,
thank you very much for Notepad++!

Here's a contribution:
User can add monitored directories to a project file. (Change request #2024 https://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/feature-requests/2024/)
- added class Directory - simple directory, capable of comparison, check last write, synchronize
- added class DirectoryWatcher - periodically scanning of Directories and message, if changed
- added class Lock and ScopeLock - basic locking
- added icons for monitored directories: closed, open and invalid monitored folder, and monitored file
- TreeItem hasn't got a string as its lparam anymore. Instead there is a base class for tree item data (TreeViewData). This data is always set, so there is no checking anymore, if the data is set. Classes which use TreeView have to implement a data class which inherits this base class.
- Monitored folder support in ProjectPanel
- Adjusted FunctionListPanel to match the new TreeViewData

FIXME: translation has to be implemented. Search for //FIXME:ha

Best regards

is filled via `fread`. Then, in some cases, a conversion is done with the help
of `Utf8_16_Read`. However, the method `Utf8_16_Read::convert` performs a call
to `strlen` on this buffer. This is obviously wrong: `\0` char should be
accepted (even if a bit strange) and the buffer is not zero-terminated.

The changes merely consist in adding an additional parameter `length` to
not have to guess the size of the buffer.

The attached screenshot shows before and after the patch. The variable `length`
actually shows the good value, whereas `lengthWithStrlen` shows the previous
computed value.

The method `FileManager::loadFileData` uses a stack-based buffer for reading
a file. However, due to the optimization used by `Utf8_16_Read` (`UnicodeConvertor`),
this buffer is not copied, but a pointer to this object is kept.
After `loadFileData`, this object is destroyed, but is used afterward
(via `UnicodeConvertor.getNewBuf`).

This patch actually follows #145 but they are independant

The non-default constructor of the class Buffer calls the inner method
`checkFileState()`, using the private variable `_currentStatus` to determine
whether some checks on the file attached to the buffer are required or not.
However this variable is properly initialized _after_.

The standard guarantees that any pointer can implicitly convert to a `void` pointer, as long as they're both identically `const`/`volatile` qualified.

Casting to a `void` pointer hides bugs, and hinders readability.

Now that we don't use `OPENFILENAMENPP` (as of a7e00affb4d19a699c6b7e5c8a6a3a1e5a5869f1), there's no way that `::GetOpenFileName` will cause an `SEH`/`C++` exception. The `try`/`catch` block is no longer necessary, and is actually wrong.

FileManager::backupCurrentBuffer() guards against being called at the same time from different threads, but it does nothing to prevent non-threadsafe access to Scintilla etc. 

In an ideal world, this feature would be turned off until it can be implemented safely (it looks like a lot of work to me, but maybe someone can think of an easy solution). I don't think that's going to happen, so as a _temporary_ fix I've added a mutex which will prevent corruption in _some_ cases (undo, redo, replace, sort).

Off-Topic: Maybe it would be better if you create a notepad-plus-plus organisation. After all, I suppose it's likely that it won't end with just one repository, and with an organisation there is a better overview over all repos related to a project. For instance, you could publish the website, so people could help with the translations easier. [It's also possible to transfer repositories, and GitHub redirects from the old location to the new one so that's not a problem either].

And close b:

After pressing Ctrl-Shift-T, b will be at the end:

I think would be better if b's position was remembered so you would get back the way it looked originally:

Project now utilizes the `/MP` compiler switch to perform parallelized builds. The number of parallel builds performed is determined on a per-machine basis based on available logical CPUs.

Long term this will provide the best performance output to code maintainability ratio compared to just enabling precompiled headers.

Using my personal machine (8 cores), I got the following timings (Debug configuration):
- Normal build: 89 seconds
- Multi-processor build: 28 seconds
- PCH enabled: 27 seconds

Note that the multi-processor build timings can be further reduced with proper dependency management and removal of existing precompiled header file (precompiledHeaders.h).

Also please note that this PR should be accepted in lieu of PR #78 which would (in contrast to what I'm proposing) enable precompiled headers which have long term impact on the maintainability of the code base (dependency management).

Specific Changes:
- Precompiled header support disabled (not compatible with `/MP` flag).
- precompiledHeader.cpp deleted.
- Solution File added.
- Minimal Rebuild (`/Gm`) disabled (ignored when `/MP` is on).

precompiledHeaders.h still exists because it contains a ton of inclusions required by lots of files. A second and less trivial cleanup will involve removing the precompiledHeaders.h file and individually correcting and satisfying dependencies in each source file in the code base.

When closing all files the user is asked if he wants to save all modified files. If he answers no to one of them while holding down one of the shift button, interpret that as "no to all" and don't ask any more questions.

Instead of guessing when a user wants a lexicographic sort vs a numeric sort, I have added options in the menu. There are now different choices for:
- lexicographic sort,
- integer sort,
- decimal sort with '.' as the decimal separator, and
- decimal sort with ',' as the decimal separator.

There are [a lot of different ways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_point#Examples_of_use) to specify a decimal number and I have only implemented the two most common ones.

Since the users now tell us what to do (instead of us trying to guess their intention) we can make the number parsing a bit more flexible. So "123abc" will be interpreted as "123" when doing a numeric sort. This allows for the case which [Guy Thevenot](https://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/discussion/331753/thread/942efd7d/) wanted:

```
8        Alan                   1            Bob
1        Bob                    4            Edward
47       Charles                8            Alan
127      David        HOW ?     12           Harold
4        Edward       ¯¯¯       47           Charles
1000     Fred                   89           Gary
89       Gary                   127          David
12       Harold                 1000         Fred
```

Some implementation notes:
- I know Don doesn't like const, but if a function takes TCHAR\* then it's very difficult to pass a generic_string to it. That's why I changed NativeLangSpeaker::messageBox to take const TCHAR\* instead.
- Generally I would not put the entire implementation of a class in a header, but due to the way templates work this is necessary for NumericSorter (see Sorter.h). And since the things which _could_ go in a .cpp file ended up being much less than the things I _had_ to put in the header, I thought it would be easier to just put everything in the header.
- At one point I throw a size_t (in NumericSorter::sort). Again, not something I'd normally do, but it's a lot easier than using several out arguments in this case (we want to inform the user which line is causing the error. You can trigger an error by doing a numeric sort where one of the lines is really long.)
- There is a speed improvement when doing integer sorting (about 30%) compared to before. Amusingly when doing integer/decimal sorting most of the time is actually not spent sorting, but converting strings to numbers.

When you imported your SVN repository to Git, you did not normalize line endings. Git does a lot of line ending normalization that SVN never did. Normally a direct import of SVN code base into Git will retain original CRLF line endings on Windows. This pull request modifies every single file in the repository to normalize line endings. That is the only change here.

Please see this article for information regarding line ending handling:
https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/

I really recommend you accept this PR as without this change, you will be constantly fighting Git on line ending settings and each developer's git configuration will determine line endings they commit, which will result in weird diffs and inconsistencies.

Consider that you have some plugins with marco shortcut configured. Then :
- Start Notepad++ with the option -noPlugin
- Stop Notepad++. 
  During the close, it rewrites the shortcut.xml. As there is no plugin loaded, the plugin section of shortcut.xml is empty.
- start Notepad++ again. **All plugin shortcut have been loosed**.

In the "find results" window it's possible to copy the results to the clipboard, but it always copies exactly what's in the window. This includes line info and file names. Sometimes you just want the actual results.

I have added a new option which does this. I have retained the old option (but it is renamed) since I suppose someone might want it.

E.g if the results look like this:

```
Search "toclipboard" (3 hits in 1 file)
  C:\Users\Andreas\Desktop\notepad-plus-plus\PowerEditor\src\ScitillaComponent\FindReplaceDlg.cpp (3 hits)
    Line 2538:  const generic_string toClipboard = stringJoin(lines, TEXT("\r\n"));
    Line 2539:  if (!toClipboard.empty())
    Line 2541:      if (!str2Clipboard(toClipboard.c_str(), _hSelf))
```

Then by right-clicking on the file name and selecting the new option "Copy (just search results)", you get this in the clipboard:

```
    const generic_string toClipboard = stringJoin(lines, TEXT("\r\n"));
    if (!toClipboard.empty())
        if (!str2Clipboard(toClipboard.c_str(), _hSelf))
```

It is also possible to click on each line and copy just that result.

See title.

I find this setting to be more of an impediment than a help in debug builds (mainly due to the "unused variables" warning which crops up if you comment something out).

Some more fixes for yesterday's sort optimization PR.

Most commits should be self-explanatory.

6e84be2 fixes a bug where the sort would insert newline at the wrong place unless the entire file was sorted. To test, create a file like this:

```
1
2

3
```

Select the first two lines and sort in ascending fashion. Using yesterday's code, the file would end up like this (note that first line is an empty line):

```

1
2
3
```

But obviously 1-2 is already in ascending order and the file should have been left untouched.

This is a chain of several commits that correspond to [**this**](http://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/patches/659/) sourceforge patch (slightly improved).
I have split it to make each functional modification easier to review.

Current "sort lines" functionality uses a custom, recursive implementation of quicksort. It becomes too slow to use after a couple of hundred lines, and is very complex to understand.

I have replaced it with the standard sort function.

I have also replaced "reverse sort" with "ascending/descending", since if one sort is designated "reverse" then you have to remember which type of sort is "normal" (something I will never be able to do).

I reworked getCloudSettingsPath/base64ToAscii.

Firstly, the line:

```
int len = base64ToAscii(pAsciiText, pB64);
```

...followed by the check:

```
if (len)
```

...failed to handle (what I assume was) the error condition, where base64ToAscii returns `-1` without initializing the buffer (thus causing an uninitialized read later on).

Secondly, there's no benefit in passing a caller-allocated buffer, because we're using a heap allocated buffer. The downside is an awkward syntax, prone to error.

So I changed it to return a `std::unique_ptr<char[]>`, and accepting (as arguments) the input string and the length of the input string (passing the already-known length [avoids recalculating it](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/e6f11a7b95e26affba59a7057776a787056af8df)).

I added some `throw std::out_of_range` calls, that I actually think I'll replace with some `assert`s _immediately_ after creating this pull request.

I further reworked `getCloudSettingsPath` to use the standardized `find_first_of`, instead of a manually written `for` loop, to find the `\n` character.

I then replaced `mbstowcs` with `mbstowcs_s`, which is more secure, and uses template parameter inference, which is fantastic.

Lastly, for `getCloudSettingsPath`, I removed the two nonsensical `catch (...)` blocks, along with their respective `try` blocks. Even if the block was more specific (say, `catch (std::bad_alloc)`, I see no reasonable case where those could throw.

The additional changes that I made to base64ToAscii were adding const, and changing `dest[k++] =` to `dest[k] =`;/`++k;`.

go to next indicator (goToNextIndicator) doesn't work when  only one character is selected. It's a classical problem of number of pole and number of interval.
The function go to previous indicatior (goToPreviousIndicator) works fine in those conditions.

The only possible way that `GetOpenFileName`/`GetCurrentDirectory` could
generate a `C++` _or_ an `SEH` exception is if `_ofn` is misaligned (it was), and
by fixing the alignment, there's no longer reason for a `try`/`catch` block.

Simply added hyperlinks in a few places in the readme. The main motivation for this was that finding the download link for the old version of Boost wasn't as straight forward as it could have been.

`loadFileData` was throwing a C++ exception, and catching it with a SEH exception handler.

Not only is this nonsensical, but it's impossible to debug, as it doesn't actually match a known SEH exception. It's a bit of a miracle that this actually worked before.

I changed it to throw a `std::bad_alloc` when scintilla returns `SC_STATUS_BADALLOC`, and a `std::exception` when it returns any other non-success status.

It catches `std::bad_alloc`, because that's expected, but doesn't catch `std::exception`, because there's no reasonable way that a std::exception can occur.

This is a fix for the issue reported [in Sourceforge ticket #5266](https://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/bugs/5266/).

I tested it, and it works properly.

`checkSingleFile` still doesn't do what's advertised ;)

downloaded, extracted, and replaced old version with files from SQLite 3.8.9 (released April 8th, 2015)

...hence the changeset **_looks**_ huge, but _I, personally, didn't change a single line_.

I've added another configuration to the Visual Studio project, which allows running static analysis.

The `vc120_xp` configs (`Unicode Debug`/`Unicode Release`) DO NOT support static analysis, and since we're (sadly) not dropping vc120_xp anytime soon, this allows us to run static analysis on a separate build (that's not to be released).

Because of some weird Internal Compiler Error™, I had to disable use of precompiled headers, which means that build times are a bit slower than usual.

Currently, building with static analysis reports ~250 errors/warnings, of which I estimate that somewhere between 100 and 150 represent actual, user-visible, bugs. At least 50 of which are serious security issues.

After adding SAL, another ~150 actual bugs show up in code analysis (assuming I remember correctly).

Passing -notabbar changes the settings. I would expect command-line arguments to only affect one session of the program.

There are a couple of ways of solving this, but to keep NPPM_HIDETABBAR backwards compatible I chose to restore the setting in the init function it is changed.
